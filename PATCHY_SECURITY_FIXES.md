## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed direct exec() of user input. Introduced secure_eval() that parses the expression into an AST, whitelists only arithmetic-related nodes, and evaluates in an empty context. Any unsupported syntax or node type yields a 400 error.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Audit all endpoints to ensure only secure_eval is exposed.
â€¢ Consider containerizing this service for additional isolation.
â€¢ Apply rate limiting to prevent CPU exhaustion attacks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- from flask import jsonify, abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions to verify correct results.
- Submit malicious payloads (e.g. __import__ or os.system) to verify rejection.
- Test edge cases (division by zero, large numbers) for stability.

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added a before_request hook to enforce authentication using an API key header loaded from environment. Validates account fields to be alphanumeric and amount to be a positive integer. Forwards a JSON payload with proper headers and handles gateway errors gracefully.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Use HTTPS to protect API keys in transit.
â€¢ Store API_KEY securely (e.g., secrets manager).
â€¢ Implement rate limits to prevent abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- from flask import abort
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt endpoint without or with wrong X-API-KEY to ensure 401.
- Use invalid account names/amounts to test validation.
- Simulate gateway error (e.g. 500) and verify error propagation.

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Implemented API key authentication, sanitized account names to alphanumeric, validated amount as a positive integer, enforced sufficient balance, and protected against directory traversal by validating the real path.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Ensure accounts.json is not world-writable.
â€¢ Serve over HTTPS.
â€¢ Rotate API keys periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call without X-API-KEY to verify 401.
- Attempt invalid accounts or negative amounts.
- Test boundary conditions: exact balance, minimal positive amount.

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string concatenation in SQL with a parameterized query using placeholders. Added input validation for 'username'.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Do not disable SQLite thread checks in production without understanding consequences.
â€¢ Consider using a connection pool or more robust database for scalability.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject typical SQL injection payloads in 'username' to confirm they fail.
- Verify normal lookups still succeed.

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed direct string formatting in SQL to a parameterized query with placeholders. Validates 'id' is numeric.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ For production, use a pool or ORM for efficiency and safety.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try SQL payload in 'id' to ensure it's rejected.
- Test valid IDs for correct behavior.

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of MongoDB's $where operator. Switched to a simple field match and validated the 'name' parameter to be strictly alphanumeric, preventing injection of malicious queries.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Consider adding pagination to limit result sets.
â€¢ Monitor for repeated invalid input patterns.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- from flask import abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send injection patterns like {$gt:'',...} to verify rejection.
- Query valid names to confirm functional behavior.

---

### web4/exec/db.py
**Issue:** Removed hard-coded FLAG variable and removed any insertion of sensitive data. Now only non-sensitive sample products are inserted. Loads credentials from environment.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Manage secrets in a secrets manager or environment, never in source code.
â€¢ Rotate credentials periodically.


**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Initialize DB and confirm no FLAG entries.
- Test read/write to products collection.

---

### web5/src/insert.py
**Issue:** Removed placeholder sensitive-looking strings. Used parameterized queries for inserts. Simplified sample data to generic non-sensitive users.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ This script is for development/testing only. Do not include in production.


**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Run the script and verify 'users.db' has expected entries without errors.
