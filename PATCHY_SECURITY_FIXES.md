## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of `exec()` on user input. Introduced `safe_eval()` which parses the expression into an AST and only permits numeric literals and a whitelisted set of arithmetic operators. Input length is capped to mitigate denial-of-service via extremely large expressions.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Further restrict allowed operators or literal types as needed.
â€¢ Consider running in a container or separate process with resource limits to defend against infinite loops or heavy CPU usage.
â€¢ Log invalid attempts for monitoring.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit tests for valid arithmetic expressions.
- Attempt injection payloads (e.g., `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')`) and verify they're rejected.
- Performance tests with maximum allowed input length.

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication check. Sanitized inputs using `ctype_digit` and `is_numeric`, then cast to appropriate types. Switched to PDO with prepared statements and enforced that the account belongs to the authenticated user via `user_id`.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Store DB credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager).
â€¢ Implement proper session timeout and regeneration to avoid session fixation.
â€¢ Use HTTPS to protect session cookies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and expired sessions.
- Attempt parameter tampering and SQL injection payloads.
- Verify unauthorized users cannot change balances.

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB `$where` with raw user input. Introduced an allowlist (`ALLOWED_FIELDS`) to restrict which document fields can be queried. Queries are built as simple key-value dictionaries, preventing JavaScript injection.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ For numeric or date fields, convert values to the correct type before querying.
â€¢ Monitor query logs for suspicious patterns.
â€¢ Consider adding rate limiting to this endpoint.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt NoSQL injection payloads (e.g., `{ "$gt": "" }`).
- Verify disallowed fields are rejected.
- Test normal lookups for allowed fields.

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL with parameterized queries (`?` placeholders). Validated that the incoming `id` is an integer before using it in the query.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Enable WAL mode and secure filesystem permissions on the SQLite file.
â€¢ Consider migrating to a client/server RDBMS for multi-user environments.
â€¢ Add rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection payloads (e.g., `1 OR 1=1`).
- Test with valid and invalid IDs.
- Monitor slow queries.

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Converted the dynamic SQL string into a parameterized query using `%s` placeholders with psycopg2. Input is validated to ensure it's an integer before the query.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Secure database credentials (e.g., environment variables).
â€¢ Restrict database user privileges to only necessary operations.
â€¢ Use connection pooling for performance and stability.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject `; DROP TABLE` payloads to confirm no execution.
- Test normal and edge-case product IDs.
- Load-test endpoint under concurrent use.

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced `os.system` with `subprocess.run` and `shell=False` to avoid shell interpretation of user input. Inputs are validated via regex for numeric account IDs and parsed as float for the amount.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Consider adding authentication/authorization checks before transfers.
â€¢ Log all transfer attempts and outcomes.
â€¢ Rate-limit the endpoint to mitigate abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- subprocess
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try command injection payloads (e.g., `; rm -rf /`).
- Verify valid transfers succeed.
- Test invalid account IDs and negative amounts.
