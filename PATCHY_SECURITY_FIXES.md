## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of exec() entirely and replaced it with a limited AST-based evaluator that only supports numeric literals and a whitelist of safe binary operators (add, sub, mul, div, pow, mod). This prevents any arbitrary Python code from running.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Only numeric arithmetic expressions are allowed.  
â€¢ Any unsupported AST node or operator raises an exception.  
â€¢ Errors are returned with a generic message to avoid information leakage.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions and confirm correct results.
- Submit disallowed code (e.g., __import__("os").system("ls")) and verify 400 response.
- Fuzz test with random strings to ensure no code execution.

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication using werkzeug.security to hash passwords, a login_required decorator to protect endpoints, and role checks for the flag. Input is validated with regex and type checks. SQL queries now use parameterized statements.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Replace app.secret_key with a strong random value stored securely.  
â€¢ Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.  
â€¢ All inputs are validated and sanitized.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- werkzeug.security
- functools.wraps
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer or flag retrieval without login and expect 401.
- Log in as non-admin and GET /flag expecting 403.
- Send invalid amount and non-numeric account to /transfer and expect 400.

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session check for authentication, used PHP filter_input() to validate and sanitize POST parameters, and switched to PDO with prepared statements to prevent injection.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Ensure HTTPS to protect session cookies.  
â€¢ Use secure, httpOnly cookies.  
â€¢ Set appropriate session cookie flags in php.ini.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST invalid and negative amounts and expect 400.
- POST without session and expect 401.
- Simulate DB failure and expect 500 with no sensitive data.

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB $where with unsanitized input. Now using a direct field query and validating that the username is strictly alphanumeric to prevent injection of Mongo operators or JavaScript.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Consider rate limiting to prevent enumeration.  
â€¢ Further harden by switching to an allowlist of known usernames if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt name with Mongo operators (e.g., {$gt: ''}) and expect 400.
- Request valid and invalid usernames to verify checks.

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL concatenation with a parameterized query (using ? placeholder) and added a simple allowlist check for alphanumeric usernames.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Always use parameterized queries for any user-supplied input.  
â€¢ Consider additional validation per application context.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL payloads in username and expect 400 or sanitized behavior.
- Request existing and non-existing users to confirm correct behavior.

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Removed unsanitized f-string in SQL and switched to a parameterized LIKE query. Added validation on 'keyword' to ensure it's a string of limited length and alphanumeric.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Further tighten search inputs if needed (e.g., allowlist specific patterns).  
â€¢ Parameterized queries eliminate SQL injection risks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via keyword (e.g., "%' OR '1'='1") and confirm safe behavior.
- Test valid searches return expected results.

---

### web4/exec/db.py
**Issue:** Removed insertion of FLAG into the database. Instead, seed only static non-sensitive data. The flag can be loaded from an environment variable when needed, not stored in DB.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Store secrets/flags in environment variables or a secrets manager, not in code or general-purpose databases.  
â€¢ Ensure environment variables are protected and not checked into version control.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify seeded data contains only non-sensitive entries.
- Ensure flag is not present in DB after seeding and is retrievable via secure endpoint.
