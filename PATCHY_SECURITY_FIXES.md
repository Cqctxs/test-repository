## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed direct exec() of user input; replaced with a safe evaluator that only supports numeric literal and basic arithmetic operators using ast. Any unsupported syntax will raise an error and prevent arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** Only arithmetic expressions are allowed. If additional functionality is needed, whitelist operators or functions explicitly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid arithmetic expressions
- Attempt code injection payloads (e.g., __import__('os')) to ensure they're rejected

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication check, used PDO prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, validated input types and amounts, enforced positive transfer amounts, and wrapped debit/credit in a transaction to maintain consistency.

**Security Notes:** Ensure session cookies are secure and httpOnly. Consider CSRF protection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt unauthenticated requests
- Try transfers with invalid data
- Test concurrent transfers

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of $where, which allows JavaScript injection. Instead, validated input with a regex whitelist and used a direct key lookup in the query object.

**Security Notes:** Always validate and sanitize user input. Avoid any dynamic query operators like $where.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with malicious input containing Mongo operators
- Verify only expected records return

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string interpolation with a parameterized query using sqlite3â€™s placeholder syntax to prevent SQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Use parameterized queries for all database interactions. Avoid concatenating SQL strings with user input.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL payloads in user_id URL

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Added input validation on length and alphanumeric content. Used psycopg2 parameter substitution to safely inject the search pattern into the SQL query.

**Security Notes:** Always combine validation with parameterized queries. Limit result sizes if needed.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test queries with SQL metacharacters

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced os.system with subprocess.run using a whitelist of allowed service names and no shell. For proxying, validated the URL prefix to prevent open proxy.

**Security Notes:** Further validate or use a reverse-proxy for production. Ensure timeouts and SSL checks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- subprocess
- shlex
- requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to start disallowed services
- Proxy to external URLs to verify rejection
