## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced use of exec on raw user input with a safe evaluation of arithmetic expressions only. We parse the input with ast, verify that only approved node types (numbers and basic operators) are present, then eval in a restricted environment with no builtins.

**Security Notes:** Avoid dynamic code execution. Use domain-specific parsers or sandboxed environments for any user-provided code. Enforce strict allowlists for AST node types.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions
- Submit invalid or malicious code to ensure it's blocked

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication with login endpoint. The /transfer route is protected by @login_required. Inputs are validated for types and ranges. External PHP gateway is invoked securely with subprocess.run and shell=False.

**Security Notes:** Use secure password hashing (bcrypt). Store secret keys securely. Implement rate limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- subprocess
- wraps from functools
- session from flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer without login
- Attempt transfer of invalid amount
- Verify PHP gateway is invoked correctly

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added token-based authentication, sanitized and validated inputs. Switched from direct file-based balance changes to a transactional, parameterized PDO update to prevent injection and concurrency issues.

**Security Notes:** Ensure auth.php implements secure token validation. Use least privilege for DB credentials.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send malformed POST data
- Attempt without Authorization header
- Test concurrent transfers

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB $where operator with unsanitized input. Now we perform a direct, parameterized lookup on the username field after validating it contains only alphanumeric characters.

**Security Notes:** Always use direct queries or proper query builders. Avoid JavaScript evaluation in queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try injection payloads in username
- Verify only alphanumeric accepted

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string interpolation with parameterized queries using placeholders (?) to prevent SQL injection. Added simple input validation.

**Security Notes:** Store hashed passwords (bcrypt) instead of plaintext. Secure the database file permissions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection in username
- Verify correct error on invalid login

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed f-string SQL query to a parameterized query using placeholders. This prevents malicious input from altering the SQL structure.

**Security Notes:** Use hashed password storage and secure error messages. Consider ORM for larger apps.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with SQL meta-characters in username
- Ensure normal profile retrieval still works
