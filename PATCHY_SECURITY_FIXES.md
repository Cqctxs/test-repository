## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of exec on user‚Äêsupplied code. Instead, we define a fixed set of allowed operations in a dictionary and dispatch to those functions. Inputs are validated to be numeric and the operation is checked against an allowlist.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Never evaluate or execute raw user code.  
‚Ä¢ Use an explicit allowlist of permitted operations.  
‚Ä¢ Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST /compute with valid operations
- POST with invalid operation
- POST with non‚Äênumeric operands
- POST division by zero case

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** ‚Ä¢ Added session‚Äêbased CSRF protection.  
‚Ä¢ Input validated with PHP filters.  
‚Ä¢ Checked user role for authorization.  
‚Ä¢ Used basename() to prevent path traversal.  
‚Ä¢ Used PDO prepared statements for balance updates.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Store CSRF token in session and in form.  
‚Ä¢ Restrict file operations to a safe directory.  
‚Ä¢ Always use prepared queries for all DB operations.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt POST without CSRF token
- POST unauthorized user role
- POST invalid parameters
- Check file written only in uploads/ directory

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of $where with user input and replaced it with a direct key‚Äêbased lookup. Validated that the username is strictly alphanumeric to block injection of operators.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Avoid $where and other JavaScript execution in queries.  
‚Ä¢ Always validate and sanitize inputs against a strict allowlist.  
‚Ä¢ Limit projection to only necessary fields.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- GET /find?username=valid
- GET with invalid characters
- GET non‚Äêexistent user

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Converted the SQL statement to use a parameterized placeholder ('?') and passed the user id as a parameter tuple. Validated that the id is an integer.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid injection.  
‚Ä¢ Validate and cast input types before using them in queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- GET /user?id=1
- GET with non‚Äênumeric id
- Test for SQL injection payload input

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f‚Äêstring SQL construction with psycopg2 parameter placeholders (%s). Validated username format before use.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Use the database adapter‚Äôs parameter substitution rather than string concatenation.  
‚Ä¢ Enforce input format constraints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- GET /profile?username=valid
- GET with special chars in username
- Attempt injection payload in username
