## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced use of exec on user-provided code with a safe AST-based evaluator that only supports numeric operations. Disallowed arbitrary code execution by whitelisting AST nodes and operators.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid using exec/eval on untrusted input.  
- If you must allow more operations, carefully extend the AST whitelist.  
- Set Flask debug=False in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator as op

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid math expressions and verify correct results.
- Attempt injection payloads (e.g. __import__('os').system) and confirm they're blocked.

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Removed os.system call and replaced with Python requests to forward JSON payload. Implemented session-based authentication and URL allowlist to prevent unauthorized or dangerous commands.

**Security Notes:** - Always validate and sanitize external URLs.  
- Use HTTPS and verify certificates.  
- Store session secret in environment variable.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to call /proxy without login and expect redirect.
- Try invalid URL prefixes and expect 400.

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication check, input sanitization with filter_var, numeric validation for amount, existence and balance checks, atomic file write with temporary file.

**Security Notes:** - Use HTTPS and secure session cookies.  
- Rotate session IDs after login.  
- Consider moving from JSON file to a database with transactions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer without login, expect 401.
- Try negative or nonnumeric amount, expect 400.
- Test concurrent transfers for race conditions.

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of $where and string concatenation. Accept only valid ObjectId as path parameter and query by _id field, preventing injection.

**Security Notes:** - Never use $where with untrusted input.  
- Always validate and coerce types for query parameters.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from bson.objectid import ObjectId

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Request with invalid user_id, expect 400.
- Attempt injection payload, ensure no unauthorized data returned.

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized query using SQLite's '?' placeholders. Added length check on input.

**Security Notes:** - Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection.  
- Limit user input size to avoid DoS.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try SQL payloads in 'q' parameter and verify no injection.

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed raw f-string SQL to parameterized query with '?' placeholders to eliminate injection. Added basic null checks.

**Security Notes:** - Never store plaintext passwords; use salted hashes (e.g. bcrypt).  
- Consider implementing rate-limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with injection strings and ensure failure.
