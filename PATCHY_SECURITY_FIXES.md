## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of exec() on arbitrary user input. Introduced a safe arithmetic evaluator using Python's ast module that only permits numeric operations. Added an authentication token check via the X-Auth-Token header so only authorized callers can invoke code evaluation.

**Security Notes:** - Always run behind HTTPS to protect the AUTH_TOKEN.
- Rotate the token regularly and store it securely (e.g., in a secret manager).
- Extend authentication to a full user/session model if needed.
- The safe evaluator supports only basic arithmetic. Do not expand allowed nodes without rigorous review.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- os
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid arithmetic expressions and verify correct results.
- Attempt to inject code (e.g., __import__('os').system('ls')) and ensure it's rejected.
- Call endpoint without or with wrong token and confirm 401 response.

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added Bearer-token authorization to ensure only authenticated users can initiate transfers. Validates that the sender field matches the authenticated username and that amount is a positive number. Uses JSON payload and forwards the same Authorization header to the backend.

**Security Notes:** - Replace the placeholder verify_token with a proper JWT implementation (e.g., PyJWT).
- Ensure secure storage of API_SECRET.
- Enforce TLS for all communications.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- requests
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt a transfer with no or invalid token (expect 401).
- Try sender != authenticated user (expect 403).
- Test valid transfer end‚Äêto‚Äêend.

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure only valid users can call the gateway. Sanitized and validated input fields. Replaced direct SQL with PDO prepared statements and wrapped updates in a transaction to avoid partial state changes.

**Security Notes:** - Keep JWT_SECRET, DB credentials in a secure vault or environment.
- Use HTTPS.
- Implement rate limiting to mitigate abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- firebase/php-jwt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Request without token (expect 401).
- Request with invalid token (expect 401).
- Test transfers with insufficient funds (expect error).
- Verify successful transfers update both accounts.

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL query with a parameterized query ('?') to safely bind the username variable and prevent SQL injection.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure sqlite file is not world-writable.
- Consider using stronger database engines for production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection payloads in username (e.g., "' OR '1'='1") and verify failure.
- Fetch existing user to confirm correct JSON response.

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed the SQL query to use a parameter ('?') to bind the username, eliminating the injection vector.

**Security Notes:** - Store and compare hashed passwords (bcrypt/scrypt).
- Rate-limit login attempts.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Attempt SQL injection in username field.

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of `$where` and string interpolation in MongoDB queries. Implemented an allowlist of permitted statuses and used a direct field match query, preventing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the database.

**Security Notes:** - Always validate user input against a whitelist.
- Consider adding rate limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via complex status parameter (e.g., "this.password=='x'").
- Fetch with valid statuses to confirm correct behavior.

---

### web4/exec/db.py
**Issue:** Removed unconditional insertion of the sensitive 'FLAG' product into the database. Now the flag is only seeded when `APP_ENV` is `development` and the value is provided via the `PRODUCT_FLAG` environment variable. Marked the record as hidden to avoid public exposure.

**Security Notes:** - Never include flags or secrets in production seed data.
- Ensure the `hidden` column is respected by public APIs (filter out hidden items).

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Deploy in production environment and verify the flag product does not exist.
- Start with APP_ENV=development and verify the hidden product is inserted.

---

### web5/src/insert.py
**Issue:** Removed the hardcoded flag string in the script. Now the flag is injected via the `DB_FLAG` environment variable at runtime. The flag is hashed using bcrypt before insertion to avoid storing the secret in plaintext.

**Security Notes:** - Store the DB_FLAG securely (e.g., in a vault).
- Use strong salt and cost parameters for bcrypt.
- Rotate secrets periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os
- bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Run script without DB_FLAG (expect failure).
- Verify that the password_hash column changes if DB_FLAG changes.
