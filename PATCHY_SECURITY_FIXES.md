## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed exec() and replaced with a safe AST-based evaluator. We validate the AST nodes against a whitelist and execute only numeric and allowed math functions in a restricted environment without builtins.

**Security Notes:** Using AST whitelisting prevents arbitrary code execution. Always validate the AST and restrict globals and builtins.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid numeric expressions
- Attempt injection payloads such as `__import__("os").system("ls")` and confirm rejection

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added token-based authentication, parameterized database queries, and input validation. Only authorized requests with correct API_TOKEN can transfer funds or retrieve the flag. Also ensure `amount` is numeric and positive.

**Security Notes:** Store API_TOKEN as an environment variable. Use HTTPS in production and rotate tokens periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt unauthenticated access and expect 401
- Use valid token and insufficient balance to expect 403
- Retrieve flag with sufficient balance

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of `$where` with string interpolation. Now using a standard dict filter for username and password, which prevents NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Passwords should be hashed with bcrypt; this code is illustrative.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection payloads in username/password
- Use valid credentials to confirm login success

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized query and validated that user_id is numeric.

**Security Notes:** Always validate inputs and use parameterized queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try `user_id=1 OR 1=1` and ensure it fails
- Fetch valid and invalid IDs

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Switched from f-string to psycopg2 parameterized query. Added basic alphanumeric validation for username.

**Security Notes:** Consider stronger validation or normalization for usernames.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection payloads
- Request valid and invalid usernames

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added API key authorization, JSON parsing, and strict validation for `account` and `amount`. Prevents unauthorized modifications and invalid data.

**Security Notes:** Store API_KEY in environment. Consider migrating from flat file to a database for integrity and concurrency.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call without API key
- Send invalid JSON
- Update valid and invalid accounts
