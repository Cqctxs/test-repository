## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced exec() with a safe evaluator based on Python's AST. Only numeric literals and a fixed set of operators (add, sub, mul, div, pow, mod) are allowed. Any other constructs or malicious code are rejected, eliminating arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Avoid using eval or exec on untrusted input.â€¢ Limit operations and data types in safe_eval.â€¢ Ensure library dependencies are up to date.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid arithmetic expressions and verify correct result
- Attempt disallowed code (e.g., __import__ calls) and ensure they're blocked

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of $where and dynamic JavaScript execution in MongoDB. Instead, validate the username with a regex allowlist and perform a direct, safe field equality query.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Always validate user inputs with allowlists.â€¢ Use direct queries instead of $where or mapReduce when possible.â€¢ Limit returned fields with projections to reduce data exposure.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid usernames
- Test injection attempts like username[$ne]='' and ensure they're rejected

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Changed string interpolation of SQL to parameterized queries using '?' placeholders. This prevents attackers from injecting SQL via the user_id parameter.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Always use parameterized queries/prepared statements.â€¢ Never format SQL with untrusted input directly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to pass "1; DROP TABLE users;" as user_id and verify it's rejected

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced direct string formatting in SQL with parameterized queries and validated the search term to be alphanumeric with a reasonable length. Uses parameter binding for the LIKE clause.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Parameterize all SQL queries.â€¢ Validate and sanitize user inputs even when using parameters.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test search with special SQL characters to ensure no injection
