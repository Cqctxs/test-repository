## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced use of exec() with ast.literal_eval wrapped in safe_eval. ast.literal_eval only permits evaluation of Python literals (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, None), preventing execution of arbitrary code. Input is validated, and invalid expressions return a 400 error.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid executing untrusted code.  
- If more advanced expressions are required, implement a strict allowlist of operations or integrate a sandboxed interpreter.  
- Always run Flask in production mode (debug=False) and behind a WSGI server.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid literals (e.g., 123, [1,2,3], {'a':1}) and ensure correct results
- Submit malicious payloads (e.g., "__import__('os').system('ls')") and verify rejection

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB $where operator with string interpolation. Instead, used a direct filter on the username field. This avoids executing JavaScript on the database and prevents NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** - Always restrict returned fields (projection) to avoid exposing sensitive data.  
- Implement rate limiting and authentication tokens to prevent enumeration.  
- Run MongoDB with user authentication and least-privilege roles.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt queries with injection payloads (e.g., username[$ne]=value) and ensure they fail
- Test valid usernames and confirm correct user data is returned

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL construction with a parameterized query using SQLite's placeholder '?'. This ensures user input is passed as a bound parameter, preventing SQL injection.

**Security Notes:** - Always use parameterized queries/prepared statements for database interactions.  
- Validate or sanitize input lengths and character sets if needed.  
- Disable debug mode in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with terms containing quotes or SQL syntax to ensure no injection
- Verify normal searches return expected results

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed raw SQL with f-strings to parameterized queries. Added bcrypt for secure password hashing/verification and session management to avoid plaintext password storage. Ensured secret_key is set for sessions.

**Security Notes:** - Store the secret_key securely (e.g., environment variable).  
- Use HTTPS to protect cookies in transit.  
- Consider setting session cookie flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite).

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection in username field and ensure failure
- Test login with correct and incorrect credentials
- Verify that session cookie is set with proper flags
