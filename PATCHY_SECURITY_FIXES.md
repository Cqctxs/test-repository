## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of exec() which allowed arbitrary code execution. We now parse the incoming expression into an AST, whitelist safe node types and restrict built-in functions. The code is compiled and evaluated in a controlled environment with no builtins, preventing malicious operations.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Only simple expressions and a small set of safe functions are allowed.  
â€¢ Rejects long or non-string inputs to avoid DoS.  
â€¢ Further hardening: consider timeouts or resource limits.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit tests for allowed expressions
- Tests for disallowed syntax (e.g., import statements)
- Fuzz tests with random input sizes

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Removed direct use of POST parameters for account identification. Now we use the authenticated session user_id. We validate and sanitize only whitelisted fields, rejecting any others. User cannot modify other users' accounts.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Ensure session cookies are secure (HttpOnly, Secure flag).  
â€¢ Limit rate of updates to prevent abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to update another user's file via forged request
- Test invalid JSON and unauthorized access

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced the unsafe f-string SQL query with a parameterized query using the SQLite driverâ€™s placeholder (â€˜?â€™). This ensures user input is never concatenated directly into SQL.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Use a connection pool for better performance.  
â€¢ Enable proper error logging, avoid exposing raw DB errors to clients.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test names with SQL control characters
- Unit tests for expected and missing users

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added an API key check on the incoming request header to prevent unauthenticated usage. We now also strictly parse and validate JSON parameters, forwarding only the minimal set.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Store API_KEY securely (e.g., secrets manager).  
â€¢ Use HTTPS and validate TLS certificates.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send requests without X-Api-Key header
- Test invalid JSON bodies
- Test successful forwarding

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of MongoDBâ€™s $where operator with string interpolation. We now pass the user-controlled 'name' directly as a filter value, preventing code execution in the database.

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Validate string lengths/types.  
â€¢ Consider indexing the 'name' field for performance.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection with JS payloads
- Test empty and overly long names
