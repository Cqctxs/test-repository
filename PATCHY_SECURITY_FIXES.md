## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced the insecure exec-based evaluation with a whitelist-parser safe_eval function. We parse the expression AST and only allow numeric literals and a limited set of math operators. All other nodes cause a ValueError, preventing arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** Ensure no debug mode in production. Restrict allowed operators further if needed. Consider timeouts or expression length limits.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator as op

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test complex expressions
- Attempt injection payloads like `__import__('os').system('id')` to confirm blocking
- Measure performance on large inputs

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication and login_required decorator. Passwords are hashed. Only logged-in users can view balance, transfer funds, or retrieve the flag. Access to the FLAG endpoint is further restricted by balance threshold.

**Security Notes:** Use HTTPS. Rotate secret_key. Move credentials to secure storage. Enforce strong password policies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session, redirect, url_for
- import hashlib
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt API calls without login
- Test invalid and valid transfers
- Verify flag access controls

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Sanitized 'account' with FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING and validated 'amount' as float. Added session-based authentication. Used PDO prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and enforce user ownership of accounts.

**Security Notes:** Restrict filter lengths. Use CSRF tokens for form submissions. Store DB credentials securely.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit negative and string amounts
- Attempt to update someone else's account
- Check SQL logs for parameterization

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of $where with string interpolation. Added input validation to only allow alphanumeric and spaces. Queries now use a direct filter on the 'category' field.

**Security Notes:** Consider limiting category length. Monitor query performance. Use indexes.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via category parameter
- Submit normal and edge-case categories

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized query using '?' placeholder. Added max length check on input. Used row_factory for safe mapping.

**Security Notes:** Use HTTPS. Consider full-text search engine for performance.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection via term
- Test normal and large terms

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Mirrors dist/app.py fix: uses parameterized query with placeholders and input validation. Removed unsafe f-string interpolation.

**Security Notes:** Consider moving DB config to environment. Sanitize other inputs similarly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Probe for SQL injection
- Check normal search results
