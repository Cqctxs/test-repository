## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of exec() on user input and replaced it with eval() in a restricted environment. We defined SAFE_GLOBALS with no builtins except safe functions and strictly validated the input to only allow digits and arithmetic operators.

**Security Notes:** By whitelisting allowed characters and functions, we prevent arbitrary code execution. Further hardening could include timeouts or using a dedicated expression parser.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid arithmetic expressions
- Attempt to inject code (e.g., __import__('os').system('rm -rf /') ) to ensure it's blocked

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication and ownership check of the source account. Used PDO prepared statements for all database operations and validated input types.

**Security Notes:** Ensure session cookie sent over HTTPS and use secure, httpOnly flags. Rate-limit transfers.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfers without login
- Transfer more than balance
- Inject SQL via POST fields

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of $where with JavaScript f-strings. We validate that the username is alphanumeric and perform a direct field match in the query to prevent NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Further tighten validation or introduce rate limiting. Ensure the MongoDB user has minimal privileges.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Pass special characters in username to test rejection
- Try injection payloads like {'$ne': null}

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string SQL with a parameterized query using placeholders. This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data.

**Security Notes:** Consider full-text search indexing for performance. Ensure the database file is not world-writable.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL payloads in 'q' parameter
- Verify special characters are escaped

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed dynamic string building to a prepared statement with %s placeholders in psycopg2. The user_id path parameter is an integer, further reducing injection risk.

**Security Notes:** Ensure database credentials are stored in environment variables or a secrets manager. Use connection pooling.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with non-numeric user_id
- Attempt SQL payload via user_id path
