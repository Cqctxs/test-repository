## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced the use of exec() which runs arbitrary code with a safe AST-based evaluator. Only whitelisted AST nodes (literal operations) can execute. Builtins are removed to prevent access to file system or OS. Code is parsed in 'eval' mode so no statements (loops, imports, attribute access) are allowed.

**Security Notes:** Ensure that only simple expressions are intended. For more complex safe evaluation, consider RestrictedPython or a dedicated sandbox. Monitor for denial-of-service via very large expressions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit simple arithmetic expressions
- Attempt disallowed constructs (e.g., __import__ ) to verify rejection
- Load a very large expression to test timeouts

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added JWT-based authentication. Each request to sensitive endpoints must include a Bearer token. Input data is validated (amount, receiver ID). Transactions use atomic peewee transactions to ensure consistency. Removed any endpoint exposing FLAG and unauthorized actions.

**Security Notes:** Rotate SECRET_KEY in production and store it securely. Ensure HTTPS is enforced. Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os
- jwt
- functools

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt /transfer without token
- Use an invalid token
- Try transferring more than balance
- Access /balance with another user's token

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication and verified that the user can only modify their own balance. Input is sanitized (balance as float) and file_put_contents uses LOCK_EX to prevent race conditions.

**Security Notes:** Transition to a database for persistence instead of JSON files. Implement CSRF protections if using cookies for auth.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try modifying another user's balance
- Send invalid JSON
- Omit session cookie and expect 401

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of MongoDB $where operator with string concatenation. Now using direct field match which safely handles the username as a parameter with no code injection risk.

**Security Notes:** Consider rate-limiting user lookup endpoint. Ensure indexes on 'username' field to optimize queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt usernames with Mongo operators (e.g., {$gt: ''})
- Query non-existent users

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced f-string interpolation in SQL queries with parameterized statements (using '?' placeholders). This ensures user inputs are properly escaped by the SQLite driver.

**Security Notes:** Passwords should be hashed (e.g., bcrypt) rather than stored in plaintext. Enforce HTTPS for transport security.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt common SQL injection payloads in username
- Verify login still works for valid credentials

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed the vulnerable f-string SQL query to a parameterized query with '?' placeholders. Inputs are now passed separately to the driver, preventing injection.

**Security Notes:** Consider further hardening by rate-limiting and hashing sensitive data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Use special characters in username parameter to test injection prevention

---

### web4/exec/db.py
**Issue:** Removed hardcoded default credentials and FLAG seeding. All sensitive URIs and flags now come from environment variables. Seeding of sensitive data only occurs in development environment.

**Security Notes:** Ensure ENV is set to 'production' in live systems. Store secrets in a secure vault or CI/CD secrets store.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Run in development and production ENV to verify seeding behavior
