## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed direct use of exec on user input. Instead, we parse user-supplied expressions with ast.parse in 'eval' mode, whitelist only arithmetic AST node types, and evaluate in a restricted global namespace with no builtins. This prevents arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** By restricting to arithmetic operations and stripping builtins, we avoid code injection. Review whitelist to adjust allowed operations. Consider rate-limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid arithmetic expressions
- Test disallowed constructs (e.g., __import__) and verify they are blocked
- Fuzz random input to ensure stability

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added token-based authentication and authorization checks. Sanitized 'account' with allowlist and validated 'amount' as float. Ensured only existing accounts are updated. Returns proper HTTP status codes.

**Security Notes:** Store API tokens securely (e.g., environment variables). For production, implement OAuth or JWT. Ensure file permissions on accounts.json are restrictive.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt update with invalid token
- Update balance for valid/invalid accounts
- Test injection payloads in 'account' field

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB $where with string interpolation. Instead, validate the 'id' parameter as a valid ObjectId and query with a standard filter dict. This prevents NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Always validate or cast user inputs before using in queries. Limit returned fields to avoid sensitive data exposure.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- bson.objectid.ObjectId

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Query with invalid id formats
- Attempt injection payload in id
- Verify password field is not returned

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string concatenation in SQL query with a parameterized query using '?'. This ensures that input is properly escaped and prevents SQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Continue to validate and sanitize inputs. Consider limiting results or adding pagination.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt typical SQL injection payloads
- Verify search results for edge cases

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Changed dynamic SQL to a parameterized query using the '?' placeholder. Also used Flask's route converter '<int:user_id>' to enforce integer type, further reducing injection risk.

**Security Notes:** Always use type converters when possible. Parameterized queries are essential for SQL safety.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
None

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication with login_required decorator. Enforced that transfer operations can only originate from the authenticated user. Removed reliance on client-side controls.

**Security Notes:** Use HTTPS to protect cookies (set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE). Store secret keys securely. Implement CSRF protection for forms.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- functools.wraps
- session management

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt operations without login
- Attempt cross-account transfer
- Validate session expiration
