## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced exec() of arbitrary code with ast.literal_eval and AST whitelist. Only safe Python literals and basic operations are allowed, preventing code injection and execution of arbitrary functions or attributes.

**Security Notes:** Use AST-based whitelisting for safe evaluation; avoid exec/eval with user input. For more complex computations, consider a dedicated sandbox or API.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to evaluate safe and unsafe expressions, ensuring rejects malicious AST nodes
- Fuzz test various inputs to confirm only literals succeed

---

### web3/param/app.py
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication and input validation. Only logged-in users can initiate transfers. Usernames are validated by regex; amounts must be positive numbers. Authorization ensures a user can only move their own funds.

**Security Notes:** Use secure password hashing (bcrypt). Store secret keys in environment variables. Implement CSRF protection for state-changing endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from functools import wraps
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt unauthorized transfers
- Test boundary conditions for amount
- Verify session expiry and logout behavior

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** Added session-based authentication, whitelisting of POST keys, and sanitization via filter_var. Prevents arbitrary modifications to the JSON store and rejects unknown parameters.

**Security Notes:** Ensure secure session cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure). Consider CSRF tokens for form submissions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to submit unauthorized keys
- Test unauthorized access without session

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed use of MongoDB $where with string interpolation. Added input validation with regex and used parameterized filter on 'username'. Projection limited returned fields.

**Security Notes:** Always validate inputs and avoid $where for dynamic queries. Use parameterized filters and explicit projections.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt NoSQL payloads in username
- Verify only expected fields are returned

---

### web5/dist/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced string-formatted SQL with parameterized query using ? placeholder. Validates that id is numeric before casting to int.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or ORM query builders. Validate and sanitize all user-supplied parameters.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject SQL metacharacters in 'id' param to ensure no injection

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Converted f-string SQL into parameterized query with placeholder. Limited input length. Prevents SQL injection via name parameter.

**Security Notes:** Prefer ORM libraries; always validate input length and character sets.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection via name parameter
- Verify wildcards only applied as intended
