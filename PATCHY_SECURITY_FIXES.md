## Implementation Notes

### web2/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of exec on user-supplied code and replaced it with ast.parse in 'eval' mode. This only allows single expressions (no statements like import, loops, etc.). We then eval the expression in a completely restricted namespace (no built-ins), preventing arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** If you need to allow more Python features, use a vetted sandbox library such as RestrictedPython. Always audit what AST nodes you permit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- jsonify
- abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit a valid arithmetic expression (e.g., '2+2') and verify output
- Submit malicious code (e.g., '__import__("os").system("ls")') and verify 400 error
- Submit syntactically invalid code and verify error handling

---

### web3/param/gateway.php
**Issue:** We sanitize the 'account' field and enforce an alphanumeric+underscore allowlist with a length check. We also restrict file writes to a single known file under a 'data' subdirectory, creating it with 0700 permissions and using file locking to prevent race conditions.

**Security Notes:** Consider adding authentication or CSRF protection around this endpoint if exposed publicly. Log failures securely without exposing sensitive data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST valid and invalid 'account' values and verify responses
- Attempt directory traversal via 'account' and verify rejection
- Check that 'data/accounts.txt' only contains allowed entries

---

### web4/exec/app.py
**Issue:** Removed the use of the MongoDB $where operator with unescaped user input. We now perform a direct key/value lookup on 'username', preventing injection of arbitrary JavaScript into the database engine. We also validate the username with a strict regex.

**Security Notes:** Always limit fields returned by the database and strip internal IDs. Monitor for excessive query volumes.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re
- abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Request with valid and invalid usernames
- Attempt injection payloads in the 'username' query string
- Confirm that only expected document fields are returned

---

### web5/src/app.py
**Issue:** Replaced the string-interpolated SQL statement with a parameterized query using '?' placeholders. This ensures the database driver safely escapes input and prevents injection. We also added length checks on the username and used sqlite3.Row to return JSON-serializable results.

**Security Notes:** Consider adding password/credential checks, rate-limiting, and account lockout policies. Use HTTPS in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Login with normal usernames
- Attempt classic SQL injection payloads in 'user' field
- Verify errors are returned gracefully and no stack traces leak
