## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code executed arbitrary code from user input without any sanitization, leading to full remote code execution risk. The fix replaces direct exec with parsing the input code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and walks the tree to validate that only safe nodes are present (basic literals and arithmetic). We then safely compile and execute this limited code in a restricted environment without built-ins to prevent malicious operations.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using exec or eval on user input. When dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, validate and sanitize input through AST parsing and restricting allowed syntax nodes. Running in restricted globals disables built-in dangerous functions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid safe arithmetic expressions execute correctly.
- Test malicious code injections (e.g., import os) are rejected with error.
- Test syntactically invalid code returns proper syntax error response

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code had no authentication or authorization, allowing anyone to post arbitrary transactions and manipulate account balances. This fix adds user login/logout via session authentication. The send_money endpoint requires a logged-in user and transfers funds only from the authenticated sender to a valid recipient with validations for inputs and sufficient balance.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate requests that modify sensitive data. Use session management with secure secrets. Validate inputs strictly to prevent injection or incorrect operations. Never trust client-supplied user identifiers without authentication context.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials
- Test accessing send_money endpoint without authentication returns 401
- Test successful money sending adjusts balances correctly
- Test sending money with insufficient funds returns error

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original PHP gateway allowed arbitrary POST requests to modify account balances with no authentication or validation. The fix adds session-based authentication checking if 'username' is set in session. It validates input amounts strictly and checks sender's balance. All unauthorized or invalid requests return proper error status and messages. This protects from unauthorized fund manipulation.

**Security Notes:** Always require authentication for sensitive operations. Use proper input validation to prevent parameter tampering. Use HTTPS in deployment to secure session cookies. Manage account balances in a proper persistent datastore rather than session in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test access without login returns 401 error
- Test valid login allows successful transaction
- Test invalid inputs are rejected
- Test overdraft attempts are blocked

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code directly interpolated user input into SQL query strings which allowed SQL injection. This fix uses parameterized queries with placeholders and passes parameters as a tuple to the execute() method to prevent injection. Additionally, input is validated to ensure user_id is numeric before querying.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions with user input. Validate input data types early to prevent injection and unexpected errors. Close database connections promptly. Use row_factory for readable row access.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test fetching users with valid numeric ids returns results
- Test SQL injection attempts with malicious input are prevented
- Test missing or invalid ids return errors

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** User input was previously directly interpolated into the SQL WHERE clause, allowing SQL injection. The fixed code uses parameterized queries with placeholders and passes the input securely as a parameter. It also performs a simple input validation to reject suspicious characters that could be used in injection.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries when querying databases with user inputs. Validate and sanitize inputs to further guard against injection and errors. Do not use string concatenation or formatting for SQL commands.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid search queries return results
- Test injection inputs like '; DROP TABLE' are rejected or do not cause harm
- Test empty or invalid input returns proper error

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used MongoDB's '$where' queries with user input which can lead to NoSQL injection and code injection attacks. The fix replaces the usage of $where with safe query builder syntax to perform exact matches. It also adds a simplistic token-based authentication check via Authorization header to protect the endpoints. Input validation with regex ensures only safe category names are accepted.

**Security Notes:** Avoid MongoDB $where queries with user input which executes JavaScript server-side. Use careful input validation and strict query construction. Add authentication and authorization checks for API endpoints exposing sensitive data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test accessing APIs without Authorization header returns 401
- Test querying with safe category names returns results
- Test querying with invalid categories returns error
- Test $where injection attempts fail or do not execute

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Although the FLAG product is inserted but unpublished, queries might retrieve it if filtering on 'published' is not enforced. The fix clarifies that all queries should filter by 'published': True. Here we also ensure initial data inserts only publish products except for the FLAG. This removes accidental exposure in listing products.

**Security Notes:** Do not insert sensitive or hidden data without enforcing strict access controls and filtering at query time. Be cautious about what data is exposed by default in APIs or queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test product listings only return products with published=True
- Test unpublished products are never returned by API

2. **Configure environment variables for secrets such as Flask SECRET_KEY and Authorization tokens.**
   - Command: `Export environment variables or update config files accordingly`
   - Verification: Verify configuration keys are loaded properly at app startup

3. **Run automated and manual security test cases targeting authentication, authorization, injection and input validation.**
   - Command: `Execute test suites and review logs for failures or unexpected behaviors`
   - Verification: All security-related tests must pass successfully

4. **Deploy updated code to production environment.**
   - Command: `Use standard deployment pipelines and monitor deployment status`
   - Verification: Access application normally and validate fixed vulnerabilities do not occur

5. **Monitor logs and application behavior for anomalies post-deployment.**
   - Command: `Use logging and monitoring tools integrated in the infrastructure`
   - Verification: No authentication bypasses, injection attempts, or errors detected


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor authentication failures and unusual login patterns
- Track database query logs for suspicious inputs or errors
- Audit access logs to sensitive endpoints
- Set alerts for repeated code execution errors or injection attempts

## üöÄ Next Steps
