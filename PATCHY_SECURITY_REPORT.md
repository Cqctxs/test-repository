## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code from user input via exec() without any sanitization or restriction, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Performs authorization checks in an insecure and incomplete manner, allowing users to send money except to 'Eatingfood'. Also, relays requests to a PHP backend that lacks input validation, leading to possible unauthorized fund manipulation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No validation or authorization on POST requests, allowing anyone to arbitrarily modify account balances via JSON file accounts.json, resulting in critical authorization bypass and possible data tampering.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query using user input directly without parameterization.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query using user input directly without parameterization.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where query with string interpolation based on user input, which can lead to NoSQL injection if user input is not strictly controlled.

#### 2. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Type:** OTHER
- **Risk:** Contains plaintext passwords, including a sensitive secret (possibly a flag), stored insecurely in the database, which could lead to sensitive data exposure.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Initializes database with sample data, including a flag stored as product description with is_published=0, limiting exposure unless there is an authorization bug in other files.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Replaced the original use of exec() on user input with a restricted eval using a safe globals dictionary, disallowing dangerous builtins and common attack keywords. This mitigates arbitrary code execution by limiting what can be run.

**Security Notes:** Avoid use of exec and eval on user input. If dynamic code execution is required, use strict sanitization and ideally run code in isolated sandboxes. Validate and whitelist allowed operations.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with various malicious payloads that attempt to use exec, import modules, access filesystem or environment.
- Validate normal functional code snippets execute successfully with restricted commands.
- Verify error messages do not leak sensitive info.

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Implemented strict authorization checks on sender and recipient. Restricted sending money to a disallowed recipient. Validated inputs including amount. Changed backend request to use JSON payload safely rather than forwarding raw data. Added proper aborts with HTTP error codes.

**Security Notes:** Always fully validate and authorize all parameters especially in financial transactions. Prefer strong identity checks and avoid bypasses. Use proper input validation and backend communication with secure protocols.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import abort
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test sending money with unauthorized users and recipients and verify requests are rejected.
- Test sending money to restricted recipient to confirm block.
- Test valid transactions pass and result in backend call.
- Perform fuzz tests with incorrect or missing data.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based user authentication and role check to restrict account modification access only to authorized admins. Added thorough JSON input validation to ensure account names only contain alphanumeric and underscores, and balance values are numeric non-negative. Added error handling and HTTP response codes to improve robustness.

**Security Notes:** Ensure session management is properly configured elsewhere with secure cookie flags and expirations. Never trust client input without validation. Limit write operations to authorized users only. Use HTTPS for session security.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify unauthorized users cannot modify accounts.
- Test valid admin user can update accounts with valid data.
- Test invalid data submission is rejected with appropriate error.
- Test concurrency conditions if applicable.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe string formatting in SQL query with a parameterized query using the SQLite library's placeholder syntax. This prevents SQL injection by passing user input as query parameters rather than concatenating strings.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with SQL databases with user input. Never interpolate user input directly in query strings.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection patterns in username parameter and verify query safety.
- Test valid usernames return correct data.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Rewritten the raw SQL string interpolation to use parameterized queries replacing the vulnerable code. This effectively prevents SQL injection attacks by separating data from code in queries.

**Security Notes:** Never build SQL queries using string interpolation with user inputs. Always use parameterization or prepared statements. Verify inputs further if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject common SQL injection payloads and confirm no data leakage or errors occur.
- Verify normal user queries work as expected.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced use of MongoDB $where query with string interpolation on user input by a parameterized regex query on a specific field. This avoids executing JavaScript code inside the database which is vulnerable to injection and attacks.

**Security Notes:** Never use $where with untrusted user input in MongoDB. Use structured queries with parameters. Sanitize and validate user input further if needed.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test inputs with MongoDB operators to see if injection is prevented.
- Verify normal queries still work correctly.

---

### 7. web5/src/insert.py
**Vulnerability:** HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Replaced plaintext password storage with hashed passwords using a secure hash function from werkzeug.security. This prevents password exposure if the database is compromised. Removed the sensitive secret from code and encrypted stored passwords instead.

**Security Notes:** Never store plaintext passwords or secrets in code or databases. Always use strong hashing algorithms with salts such as bcrypt or PBKDF2. Protect secret flags or tokens outside the source code.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Ensure password hashes are stored, not plaintext.
- Verify users can authenticate with original password after hashing if applicable.
- Attempt to retrieve passwords from DB to confirm no plaintext.
