## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (6)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-supplied code via exec(), leading to remote code execution.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or input validation on money transfer endpoints and direct flag exposure logic vulnerable to parameter manipulation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No validation or sanitization of POST fields, enabling unauthorized balance manipulation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where with unsanitized string interpolation, allowing NoSQL injection.

#### 5. app.py (Python)

### Medium Risk Files (1)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`

### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Only initializes database schema and inserts static data; no external input processing.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of exec() entirely and replaced it with a limited AST-based evaluator that only supports numeric literals and a whitelist of safe binary operators (add, sub, mul, div, pow, mod). This prevents any arbitrary Python code from running.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Only numeric arithmetic expressions are allowed.  
‚Ä¢ Any unsupported AST node or operator raises an exception.  
‚Ä¢ Errors are returned with a generic message to avoid information leakage.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions and confirm correct results.
- Submit disallowed code (e.g., __import__("os").system("ls")) and verify 400 response.
- Fuzz test with random strings to ensure no code execution.

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication using werkzeug.security to hash passwords, a login_required decorator to protect endpoints, and role checks for the flag. Input is validated with regex and type checks. SQL queries now use parameterized statements.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Replace app.secret_key with a strong random value stored securely.  
‚Ä¢ Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.  
‚Ä¢ All inputs are validated and sanitized.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- werkzeug.security
- functools.wraps
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer or flag retrieval without login and expect 401.
- Log in as non-admin and GET /flag expecting 403.
- Send invalid amount and non-numeric account to /transfer and expect 400.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session check for authentication, used PHP filter_input() to validate and sanitize POST parameters, and switched to PDO with prepared statements to prevent injection.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Ensure HTTPS to protect session cookies.  
‚Ä¢ Use secure, httpOnly cookies.  
‚Ä¢ Set appropriate session cookie flags in php.ini.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST invalid and negative amounts and expect 400.
- POST without session and expect 401.
- Simulate DB failure and expect 500 with no sensitive data.

---

### 4. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of MongoDB $where with unsanitized input. Now using a direct field query and validating that the username is strictly alphanumeric to prevent injection of Mongo operators or JavaScript.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Consider rate limiting to prevent enumeration.  
‚Ä¢ Further harden by switching to an allowlist of known usernames if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt name with Mongo operators (e.g., {$gt: ''}) and expect 400.
- Request valid and invalid usernames to verify checks.

---

### 5. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced f-string SQL concatenation with a parameterized query (using ? placeholder) and added a simple allowlist check for alphanumeric usernames.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Always use parameterized queries for any user-supplied input.  
‚Ä¢ Consider additional validation per application context.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL payloads in username and expect 400 or sanitized behavior.
- Request existing and non-existing users to confirm correct behavior.

---

### 6. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed unsanitized f-string in SQL and switched to a parameterized LIKE query. Added validation on 'keyword' to ensure it's a string of limited length and alphanumeric.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Further tighten search inputs if needed (e.g., allowlist specific patterns).  
‚Ä¢ Parameterized queries eliminate SQL injection risks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via keyword (e.g., "%' OR '1'='1") and confirm safe behavior.
- Test valid searches return expected results.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed insertion of FLAG into the database. Instead, seed only static non-sensitive data. The flag can be loaded from an environment variable when needed, not stored in DB.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Store secrets/flags in environment variables or a secrets manager, not in code or general-purpose databases.  
‚Ä¢ Ensure environment variables are protected and not checked into version control.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify seeded data contains only non-sensitive entries.
- Ensure flag is not present in DB after seeding and is retrievable via secure endpoint.

   - Verification: Attempt $where injection and verify rejection

3. **Deploy SQL fixes for web5**
   - Command: `scp web5/dist/app.py web5/src/app.py user@server:/path/to/`
   - Verification: Test SQL endpoints with injection and ensure safe responses

4. **Deploy PHP gateway.php fix**
   - Command: `scp web3/param/gateway.php user@server:/path/to/web3/param/`
   - Verification: POST unauthorized requests and verify 401/400 responses

5. **Deploy Python auth fixes for web3/param/app.py**
   - Command: `scp web3/param/app.py user@server:/path/to/web3/param/`
   - Verification: Test login, transfer and flag routes for auth enforcement

6. **Update db.py seeding logic and environment vars**
   - Command: `scp web4/exec/db.py user@server:/path/to/web4/exec/`
   - Verification: Run seed script and inspect DB contents for no flag


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor application logs for repeated 400/401 errors indicating attack attempts.
- Alert on any SQL/NoSQL injection pattern in user inputs.
- Review authentication failure rates and lock out suspicious IP addresses.

## üöÄ Next Steps
