## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (4)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code submitted via web form without any sanitization or sandboxing, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Processes financial transactions without authentication or authorization, accepts POST data to modify JSON balances directly, subject to arbitrary account manipulation and financial fraud. No input validation or authorization controls.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability via unsanitized SQL query with user-supplied username in f-string, allowing arbitrary SQL execution on login.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query using user input, allowing arbitrary query manipulation in login functionality.


### Medium Risk Files (3)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on an external PHP gateway for account transactions without proper authorization checks; potential for unauthorized fund transfers. Also invokes system commands with os.system which can be risky.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB with dynamic JavaScript ($where) queries which can lead to injection risks; public API lacks authentication and authorization checks exposing product data. Contains environment flag but no direct leaks.

#### 3. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Database initialization script inserts products including a special 'FLAG' product with the flag as description, but is_published is 0 so not listed. Potential info leak risk if unpublished data is accessible.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Inserts sample data including sensitive flag fragments as passwords into sqlite users.db; mostly low risk as it is a one-time data script.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed exec() on user input and replaced with a safe AST-based evaluator (safe_eval) that only supports numeric literals and basic arithmetic operators. This prevents arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** Never use exec() or eval() on user-supplied code. Use AST parsing or a sandboxed execution environment. Log and monitor unexpected evaluation errors.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions and verify results
- Attempt dangerous code (import os, __import__) and confirm rejection
- Fuzz with random input to ensure no crash

---

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication, input validation and sanitization for account IDs and amount, and enforced authorization so only the owner can transfer funds. Returned proper HTTP status codes.

**Security Notes:** Use HTTPS for session cookies, set secure and HttpOnly flags. Consider moving to database-backed ledger instead of JSON file.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer without login (expect 401)
- Use invalid inputs (negative, non-numeric)
- Try transferring from another user's account (expect 403)

---

### 3. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized SQLite queries using placeholders (?). This prevents attacker-controlled input from altering SQL structure.

**Security Notes:** Store passwords hashed (e.g., bcrypt) instead of plaintext. Rotate secret keys and use environment variables.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection payloads in username/password
- Test valid login and invalid credentials
- Verify no syntax error leaks

---

### 4. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Applied parameterized queries in both login endpoints to eliminate SQL injection risk. Ensured session-based login flow.

**Security Notes:** Consider hashing passwords and using secure session storage.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject SQL payloads and confirm login is denied
- Test both GET and POST paths
- Check session cookie flags

---

### 5. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** COMMAND_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed os.system and switched to HTTP call via requests. Validated inputs with allowlist (isalnum and positive numbers) and enforced session-based authentication and authorization.

**Security Notes:** Set secure, HttpOnly flags on cookies. Use a real OAuth2 or session service. Limit request timeout.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- requests
- subprocess

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Supply invalid acct name
- Send negative amount
- Call endpoint without session

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed usage of $where and dynamic JavaScript in Mongo queries. Applied a strict regex allowlist to validate input and used a structured filter. Added Flask-Login for authentication.

**Security Notes:** Enable MongoDB authentication, restrict network access, and use least-privilege user. Always validate user roles for endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re
- flask_login

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send injection payloads in code param
- Access without login
- Request unpublished product

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed insertion of unpublished FLAG product into the database script. Sensitive flags should be stored in a secure vault, environment variable, or separate secrets service.

**Security Notes:** Ensure config files and DB initialization scripts do not contain secrets. Use vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) or environment variables.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify no unpublished entries exist
- Check config does not expose flag

---

### 8. web5/src/insert.py
**Vulnerability:** WEAK_CRYPTOGRAPHY  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced plaintext passwords with salted hashes using werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash (PBKDF2 by default). Removed flag fragments from password data.

**Security Notes:** Use strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2). Never store secrets in code. Rotate passwords periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- werkzeug.security

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify stored passwords are hashed
- Attempt login with correct/incorrect passwords

---
