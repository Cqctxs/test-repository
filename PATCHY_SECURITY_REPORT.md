## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code submitted by users via the /run POST endpoint without any sanitization or sandboxing, leading to remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization checks in critical money transfer functions; allows arbitrary POST data to gateway.php which updates JSON account balances without validation, leading to account manipulation and possible unauthorized fund transfers.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Processes POST data updating user balances in accounts.json without authentication or validation; vulnerable to arbitrary fund manipulation and lacks authorization enforcement.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses unsanitized user input directly in SQL query (string formatting), leading to SQL injection vulnerability on username parameter in /login_username POST endpoint.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses unsanitized user input directly in SQL query (string formatting), leading to SQL injection vulnerability on username parameter in /login_username POST endpoint.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with unescaped filter parameters allowing potential NoSQL injection; unclear role-based access control or authorization checks.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive FLAG data embedded in database initialization code with is_published flag set to 0, but improper access controls could leak it.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization and sample user data insertion script; no direct vulnerabilities but contains plaintext passwords and sample FLAG-like data.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the use of exec for running arbitrary user-submitted code with a safe evaluation function using Python's AST module to parse and restrict execution to only safe, limited Python expressions (like simple calculations). This prevents arbitrary code execution by limiting the operations and names that can be used.

**Security Notes:** User code execution is sandboxed to prevent remote code execution vulnerabilities. No exec or eval on raw user input is used. Only a strict set of expressions and builtins (abs, min, max, sum, len, range) are allowed. This minimal evaluator can be further extended for more controlled functionality.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import _ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with multiple code snippets including safe expressions and malicious code attempts.
- Ensure only limited functions and expressions can be executed.
- Test for common RCE payloads and confirm they're blocked.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added user authentication and role-based authorization checks before allowing critical money transfer functionality. Users must log in, and only users with admin role can perform fund transfers. This prevents unauthorized access and manipulation of account balances.

**Security Notes:** Session management uses Flask's secure session with a secret key. Passwords are stored in plaintext here for example, but should be hashed in production with libraries like bcrypt. All inputs are validated with type checks and range checks for the amount. The accounts file operations use read-modify-write with truncation to maintain data integrity.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from functools import wraps
- import os
- from flask import session, redirect

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test unauthorized requests to transfer endpoint are blocked.
- Test authorized transfers succeed and update balances correctly.
- Test concurrent transfers for race conditions or data corruption.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session authentication and authorization checks to ensure only authorized users (admins) can perform balance updates. Input parameters are validated for presence and type. The accounts file is checked for existence and validity before manipulation. Transfers verify sufficient funds before proceeding.

**Security Notes:** Ensured user session is checked at start. Input validation limits injection risks. Reading and writing JSON data carefully ensures no corruption. Using JSON encoding functions protects data integrity. Use HTTPS and secure session cookie flags in deployment.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized access blocked.
- Test input validation rejects malformed requests.
- Test successful transfer updates balances correctly.
- Test concurrent access for race conditions.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the vulnerable string formatting SQL query with a parameterized query using the '?' placeholder and passing user input as a parameter tuple. This prevents SQL injection by separating query syntax from data values.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection. Validate and sanitize user inputs, but parameterized queries are essential as first defense.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login functionality with normal and malicious username inputs containing SQL payloads.
- Verify no SQL errors or injections occur.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Fixed SQL injection by modifying the SQL query to use parameterized statements instead of directly formatting the username into the query string. This separates data from code and prevents injection attacks.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries with user input to prevent SQL injection. Avoid any query string construction via concatenation or string formatting with untrusted input.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with SQL injection payloads and confirm they're not executed.
- Validate normal functional behavior is preserved.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed usage of MongoDB $where queries with unescaped filter parameters and replaced them with exact match queries using a safe key/value filter. Added input validation to allow only alphanumeric and underscore characters for the filter parameter to prevent NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Avoid $where and JavaScript evaluation queries in MongoDB when accepting user input. Always use proper query builders and strict input validation or allowlists to prevent injection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with various filter inputs including injection attempts to verify no unauthorized queries can be made.
- Test normal queries work as expected.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed hardcoded exposure of FLAG in code initialization. Instead, the flag is stored in the database but only inserted if an 'is_published' flag is set to a non-zero value to control access. Access control for flag data must be implemented at the query or application level to prevent unauthorized retrieval.

**Security Notes:** Sensitive flags or secrets should never be exposed in code or accessible without strict access control. Use environment variables or secure vaults with proper access management. Limit read access to sensitive tables.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify that flag data is not accidentally returned to unauthorized users.
- Test flag insertion only works when is_published flag is set.
