## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code executed user-protected input directly with exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution.
This fix replaces exec() with an AST parsing method that walks the syntax tree to disallow unsafe statements like import, exec call, and uncontrolled function calls.
Only specific safe built-in functions defined in SAFE_NAMES can be called.
This limits code execution to a tightly controlled subset, preventing remote code execution.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid using exec() or eval() with user input.
- Use parsing methods such as ast to validate syntax and disallow risky nodes.
- Define a whitelist of allowed functions and disallow imports.
- Consider sandboxing or containerizing code execution if needed for isolation.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import sys
- import traceback

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test execution of allowed code snippets.
- Test attempts to use disallowed keywords or calls (import, exec, system calls).
- Verify no arbitrary system commands can be executed.

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code modified account balances based on user input without authentication or validation, allowing unauthorized privilege escalation and money transfer.
This fix adds session-based authentication and checks that the user role is 'admin' before allowing modifications.
Input parameters are sanitized and validated to prevent injection or malformed data.
Prepared statements are used to mitigate SQL injection risks in the balance update query.

**Security Notes:** - Always authenticate users before performing sensitive operations.
- Use role-based access control to limit functions to authorized users.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use prepared statements for all database queries involving user data.
- Use HTTPS to protect sessions and credentials in transit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt balance modification without login, expect denial.
- Try with non-admin user roles to verify access is denied.
- Test correct balance updates with authorized admin user.
- Test SQL injection attempts in POST fields.

---

### 3. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code concatenated user input directly into SQL queries, exposing it to SQL injection attacks.
This fix uses parameterized queries (prepared statements) which separate query structure from data.
The user input is passed as a parameter tuple to cursor.execute(), ensuring proper escaping and validation by the database driver.

**Security Notes:** - Always use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation for SQL queries.
- Validate and sanitize inputs when applicable.
- Keep database connections short-lived and properly closed.
- Use ORM libraries where possible to add abstraction and protection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid user IDs and verify returned data.
- Test with malicious input containing SQL keywords or special characters.
- Use automated SQL injection tools to verify resilience.

---

### 4. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** User input was interpolated directly into the SQL query, vulnerable to injection attacks.
This fix uses a parameterized placeholder '?' with a tuple argument to the execute() method of the cursor, preventing SQL injection.
User input is no longer concatenated as raw SQL string.
This approach is a standard best practice for working with SQL in Python.

**Security Notes:** - Always use parameterized SQL for dynamically provided parameters.
- Validate inputs where applicable.
- Use connection pooling or ORM to help with security and maintenance.
- Enable debug=False in production environments to avoid info leaks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify user retrieval with valid and invalid IDs.
- Test database with maliciously crafted id parameters.
- Ensure no SQL errors exposing schema or internals.

---

### 5. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Original code allowed send-money actions without verifying authentication or user roles, leading to unauthorized transfers.
The fix adds session authentication checks and verifies that the user has the proper 'user' role before processing the transaction.
Input parameters are validated for presence and type.
Aborts with HTTP error codes are used for unauthorized or malformed requests.
This ensures that only authorized and validated requests proceed.

**Security Notes:** - Always authenticate users and check roles for sensitive actions.
- Use secure session management and protect session secrets.
- Validate all input data thoroughly.
- Consider implementing CSRF tokens for POST endpoints.
- Use TLS/HTTPS to protect session data in transit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session, abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test accesses without login to ensure denial.
- Test with different user role values to verify role enforcement.
- Test send-money with valid and invalid data to verify input validation.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used the MongoDB $where operator with string interpolation from user input, which allows NoSQL injection.
This fix validates the input string and uses a standard dictionary query instead, avoiding execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the database.
Special characters associated with MongoDB operators are disallowed in input.
This significantly mitigates injection risks while preserving the functionality of searching users by name.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid using $where or any JavaScript execution with user inputs in MongoDB queries.
- Always validate and sanitize inputs.
- Use safe query dictionary syntax to interact with MongoDB.
- Consider limiting result set size and fields returned.
- Use latest security patches for MongoDB and drivers.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test search with valid and invalid names.
- Attempt queries with injection patterns to confirm failure.
- Verify no blocking of legitimate characters needed by app logic.
