## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (3)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-submitted code with exec(), leading to remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses unsanitized user input directly in an SQL query, vulnerable to SQL injection.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses unsanitized user input directly in an SQL query, vulnerable to SQL injection.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Lacks input validation and authorization; susceptible to unauthorized balance modifications and potential injection attacks.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on an untrusted PHP backend for critical operations without authentication or input validation, allowing potential unauthorized fund transfers.


### Low Risk Files (3)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB queries with string interpolation which may lead to injection if inputs were from user-controlled sources; no direct user input shown here though.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Initializes database with sample data; no apparent security risks in this setup script.

#### 3. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Populates SQLite database with sample user data; no direct security risk but contains dummy flag data.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed direct use of exec() and replaced it with a safe_eval() function that: 1) Parses the submitted code into an AST; 2) Walks the nodes to allow only arithmetic and numeric operations; 3) Evaluates in an empty global/local context to prevent access to builtins or modules. This eliminates arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Always restrict which AST node types are permitted when evaluating user input.  
‚Ä¢ Do not enable debug mode in production.  
‚Ä¢ If more complex operations are needed, consider using a sandbox or a dedicated mathematical expression library.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test safe_eval() with allowed and disallowed expressions
- Fuzz test with random inputs
- Verify no builtins or __import__ appear in AST

---

### 2. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL statements with a parameterized query using '?'. This prevents an attacker from injecting malicious SQL via the username parameter.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Always prefer parameterized/prepared statements.  
‚Ä¢ Validate or sanitize inputs further (e.g., length or character set) if necessary.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test get_user() with normal, empty, and SQL payload usernames
- Verify no unexpected rows are returned for injection attempts

---

### 3. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Cast the incoming id to integer and use a parameterized query to ensure the value cannot inject SQL. Rejects invalid id formats up front.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Validate types and ranges for numeric inputs.  
‚Ä¢ Continue to use parameterized queries for all database access.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test with valid and invalid ids
- Attempt injection strings in id parameter

---

### 4. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session-based authorization checking to ensure only authenticated admins can modify balances. Used filter_input() to validate and sanitize id and amount. Converted raw SQL into a prepared statement.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Store session data securely (e.g., secure cookie flags).  
‚Ä¢ Limit permissions to specific roles.  
‚Ä¢ Log all balance changes for auditing.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt access without login
- Test with non-admin user
- Supply invalid and large numeric values
- Verify SQL injection attempts fail

---

### 5. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1) Added session-based authentication before allowing transfers.  
2) Validated that id is an integer and amount is a positive Decimal.  
3) Sent the request to the PHP gateway over JSON with a Bearer token in the Authorization header.  
4) Handled request exceptions and timeout.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Keep FLASK_SECRET_KEY and API_TOKEN in environment variables, not code.  
‚Ä¢ Use HTTPS to protect Authorization header.  
‚Ä¢ Implement rate limiting and logging on transfer endpoint.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- from decimal import Decimal, InvalidOperation
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test transfer endpoint without login
- Test with invalid id and amount
- Test authorization header missing or invalid
- Simulate gateway failures and latency

## üìã Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Backup current codebase and database
- Ensure environment variables for secrets are configured
- Install any new dependencies (flask,jsonify,requests)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Merge fixes into main branch**
   - Command: `git checkout -b security-fixes && git apply fixes.patch`
   - Verification: Code compiles and lint passes

2. **Set or update environment variables**
   - Command: `export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=... && export API_TOKEN=...`
   - Verification: echo $API_TOKEN

3. **Install dependencies**
   - Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Verification: pip freeze | grep flask

4. **Deploy to staging and run automated tests**
   - Command: `pytest`
   - Verification: All tests green

5. **Promote to production**
   - Command: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
   - Verification: Pods ready; health endpoint returns 200


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor error rates on execute and transfer endpoints
- Alert on 500 responses from gateway
- Log all balance change attempts with user_id and outcome

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review each security issue carefully** - Understand the vulnerability and proposed fix
2. **Test the fixes in a development environment** - Ensure functionality is preserved
3. **Apply fixes in priority order** - Start with high-confidence, high-impact fixes
4. **Update dependencies** - Install any additional required packages
5. **Run security tests** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Deploy to production** - Follow your standard deployment process
7. **Monitor for issues** - Watch logs and metrics after deployment
