- **Risk:** SQL injection via f-string in SQL query without sanitization

#### 4. app.py (Python)

### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. gateway.php (PHP)

- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No input validation or sanitization on POST parameters allows unauthorized fund manipulation

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP

- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Risk:** Duplicate of src, categorized already


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced direct exec() call with a safe AST-based evaluator that only allows literal numbers, basic arithmetic operators, and no function calls or attribute access. We parse the user input, validate AST node types against a whitelist, compile and evaluate in an empty builtins environment.

**Security Notes:** - Only integer, float, and basic arithmetic operations are permitted.\n- No names, attribute access, function calls, or import statements are allowed.\n- This approach prevents remote code execution by disallowing exec/eval of arbitrary code.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid expressions like "2+3*4" and verify correct result
- Send malicious payloads such as "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')" and verify they're rejected
- Test edge cases e.g. empty input, extremely large numbers

---

### 2. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed f-string concatenation in the SQL query and replaced it with a parameterized query using the '?' placeholder. This ensures that user-supplied input is not interpreted as SQL code.

**Security Notes:** - Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with SQL databases.\n- Never construct SQL queries by concatenating or interpolating user input.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to inject SQL via the user_id parameter such as "/user/1 OR 1=1" and verify it's rejected
- Test with valid user IDs to ensure correct functionality remains intact

---

### 3. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed f-string-based SQL query to a parameterized query using '%s' placeholders and passing a tuple of parameters to execute(). This prevents SQL injection by letting the driver properly escape the input.

**Security Notes:** - For LIKE queries, wrap the user input in wildcards outside of the query string, not via interpolation.\n- Ensure database credentials are stored securely, e.g., via environment variables or a secrets manager.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection such as name="%' OR '1'='1" and confirm no unauthorized data returned
- Verify search functionality with normal and empty inputs

---

### 4. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of $where which executes JavaScript. Instead, we build a safe filter dict using only equality matches on validated fields. We also validate ObjectId input for retrieving individual posts.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid MongoDB $where or eval-based queries when including user input.\n- Always validate or cast identifiers (e.g., ObjectId) before use.\n- Use projection to limit returned fields.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from bson.objectid import ObjectId

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via author parameter containing JavaScript and verify it's treated as a literal string
- Test retrieving posts by valid and invalid ObjectId values

---

### 5. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check. Used PHP filter_input() with FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT and FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING to validate and sanitize POST data. Enforced a static allowlist of valid recipients to prevent arbitrary targets.

**Security Notes:** - Always validate numeric inputs (amount) and ensure they‚Äôre positive.\n- Use allowlists for categorical data (recipient).\n- Authenticate requests before performing sensitive actions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit malformed amount values (negative, string) and expect 400
- Try unauthorized recipients and expect 403
- Access without session and expect 401

---

### 6. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Enforced session-based authentication. Validated and converted amount to float, rejecting invalid or non-positive values. Implemented an allowlist for recipients. Used secure HTTPS to call backend service and passed an auth token in headers instead of trusting arbitrary query parameters.

**Security Notes:** - Do not trust unverified backend responses; propagate errors carefully.\n- Maintain a clear separation between authentication (who you are) and authorization (what you can do).\n- Use HTTPS and authorization headers for internal service calls.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer with missing or invalid session
- Try invalid recipients and confirm 403
- Mock backend failure and confirm 502 response
