## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-supplied code with exec(), leading to Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No proper authentication or authorization; user can send arbitrary requests which pass data directly to PHP gateway manipulating accounts.json without validation. Also environment FLAG leaked in response under conditions.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Directly modifies accounts.json from user-supplied POST data without validation, allows negative amounts to cause unauthorized balance changes. No authentication or authorization.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized concatenation of user input into SQL query.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized concatenation of user input into SQL query.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses $where queries with user-controlled input for MongoDB, potential injection risk; exposure of FLAG in db.py but not used here directly.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Contains FLAG environment variable in code and inserts it as a product, although unpublished; potential info disclosure if published accidentally.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Initializes database with sample users; no immediate security risk but contains example sensitive-looking strings.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed direct exec() of user input. Introduced secure_eval() that parses the expression into an AST, whitelists only arithmetic-related nodes, and evaluates in an empty context. Any unsupported syntax or node type yields a 400 error.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Audit all endpoints to ensure only secure_eval is exposed.
‚Ä¢ Consider containerizing this service for additional isolation.
‚Ä¢ Apply rate limiting to prevent CPU exhaustion attacks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- from flask import jsonify, abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid arithmetic expressions to verify correct results.
- Submit malicious payloads (e.g. __import__ or os.system) to verify rejection.
- Test edge cases (division by zero, large numbers) for stability.

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added a before_request hook to enforce authentication using an API key header loaded from environment. Validates account fields to be alphanumeric and amount to be a positive integer. Forwards a JSON payload with proper headers and handles gateway errors gracefully.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Use HTTPS to protect API keys in transit.
‚Ä¢ Store API_KEY securely (e.g., secrets manager).
‚Ä¢ Implement rate limits to prevent abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- from flask import abort
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt endpoint without or with wrong X-API-KEY to ensure 401.
- Use invalid account names/amounts to test validation.
- Simulate gateway error (e.g. 500) and verify error propagation.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Implemented API key authentication, sanitized account names to alphanumeric, validated amount as a positive integer, enforced sufficient balance, and protected against directory traversal by validating the real path.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Ensure accounts.json is not world-writable.
‚Ä¢ Serve over HTTPS.
‚Ä¢ Rotate API keys periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call without X-API-KEY to verify 401.
- Attempt invalid accounts or negative amounts.
- Test boundary conditions: exact balance, minimal positive amount.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string concatenation in SQL with a parameterized query using placeholders. Added input validation for 'username'.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Do not disable SQLite thread checks in production without understanding consequences.
‚Ä¢ Consider using a connection pool or more robust database for scalability.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject typical SQL injection payloads in 'username' to confirm they fail.
- Verify normal lookups still succeed.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed direct string formatting in SQL to a parameterized query with placeholders. Validates 'id' is numeric.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ For production, use a pool or ORM for efficiency and safety.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try SQL payload in 'id' to ensure it's rejected.
- Test valid IDs for correct behavior.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed the use of MongoDB's $where operator. Switched to a simple field match and validated the 'name' parameter to be strictly alphanumeric, preventing injection of malicious queries.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Consider adding pagination to limit result sets.
‚Ä¢ Monitor for repeated invalid input patterns.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os
- from flask import abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send injection patterns like {$gt:'',...} to verify rejection.
- Query valid names to confirm functional behavior.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed hard-coded FLAG variable and removed any insertion of sensitive data. Now only non-sensitive sample products are inserted. Loads credentials from environment.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Manage secrets in a secrets manager or environment, never in source code.
‚Ä¢ Rotate credentials periodically.


**Additional Dependencies:**
- import os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Initialize DB and confirm no FLAG entries.
- Test read/write to products collection.

---

### 8. web5/src/insert.py
**Vulnerability:** OTHER  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed placeholder sensitive-looking strings. Used parameterized queries for inserts. Simplified sample data to generic non-sensitive users.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ This script is for development/testing only. Do not include in production.


**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Run the script and verify 'users.db' has expected entries without errors.

   - Verification: Run linting and static analysis.

2. **Export environment variables on target hosts.**
   - Command: `export API_KEY=... & export MONGO_URI=... & export GATEWAY_URL=...`
   - Verification: echo $API_KEY $MONGO_URI $GATEWAY_URL

3. **Restart or redeploy services (Flask apps, PHP server).**
   - Command: `systemctl restart web2 web3 web4 web5`
   - Verification: Ensure services are running via health-check endpoint.

4. **Run functional and security smoke tests.**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: Use automated test suite to exercise endpoints.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor authentication failures and error rates.
- Use a Web Application Firewall to detect injection patterns.
- Periodically scan logs for anomalies and failed validation attempts.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review each security issue carefully** - Understand the vulnerability and proposed fix
2. **Test the fixes in a development environment** - Ensure functionality is preserved
