## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses Python's exec on user-submitted code with no sanitization or restriction, enabling arbitrary code execution on the server, a critical security vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies entirely on a PHP backend for critical financial updates without validation; no authentication or authorization to restrict sending money, allowing arbitrary financial transaction manipulation. Also uses unsanitized data passed to PHP; potential injection or abuse risks.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No sanity checks or authentication on POST requests allowing anyone to modify accounts.json to arbitrarily transfer money between accounts leading to critical financial manipulation vulnerability.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Directly injects username into SQL query without parameterization, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability allowing attackers to manipulate database.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Directly injects username into SQL query without parameterization, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability allowing attackers to manipulate database.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where with string interpolation for filtering, which may lead to NoSQL injection if user-controlled data is not sanitized properly. Some sensitive data (FLAG) is stored but not published.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains embedded FLAG value and database initialization logic, but no direct user input handling; risks depend on combined app usage.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Script to insert users into SQLite database; no direct exposure but use of plain text passwords is poor practice.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the use of exec() with a safe_eval() function that parses the user-supplied expression using the ast module. We walk the AST to allow only numeric literals and arithmetic operators. We disallow all other nodes, aborting with HTTP 400 on any violation. The call to eval() is sandboxed by removing builtins, preventing any arbitrary code execution.

**Security Notes:** Only simple arithmetic expressions are permitted. For more complex sandboxing, use a dedicated sandbox service or container. Do not reintroduce exec or eval with user code. Ensure Flask is up to date.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST valid arithmetic expressions and verify correct result.
- POST malicious Python code (e.g. "__import__('os').system('ls')") and confirm HTTP 400 error.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication with a login endpoint and login_required decorator. Validated that the sender account matches the authenticated user. Sanitized 'from', 'to' (digits only) and 'amount' (numeric, positive). Switched to JSON body and Bearer token when calling the PHP backend.

**Security Notes:** Implement the authenticate() function against a secure user store. Rotate SECRET_KEY and BACKEND_TOKEN via environment variables. Enforce HTTPS and timeouts.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- re
- os
- decimal
- flask.sessions

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt send without login; expect redirect to /login.
- Login as user 123, attempt sending from different account; expect HTTP 403.
- Send non-numeric account or negative amount; expect HTTP 400.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added Authorization header check against a server-side API_TOKEN. Sanitized and validated 'from', 'to' (digits only) and 'amount' (numeric, positive). Used file locking (flock) to prevent race conditions. Checked account existence and sufficient balance before updating.

**Security Notes:** Store API_TOKEN in environment variables and rotate periodically. Use HTTPS to protect the token in transit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call endpoint without Authorization header; expect 401.
- Use invalid token; expect 403.
- Attempt transfer with non-digit account; expect 400.
- Simulate concurrent transfers; file lock should serialize and prevent corruption.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL statement with a parameterized query using '?' placeholder. Added basic alphanumeric check on username to further restrict input. Ensured proper connection and cursor handling.

**Security Notes:** Consider preparing statements at connection time. Enforce least-privilege SQLite user if possible. Regularly update dependencies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Pass normal usernames; verify correct response.
- Attempt username with SQL syntax (' OR 1=1); expect 400 or 404.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed the SQL query to use a parameterized placeholder '?' and passed the username as a tuple. This eliminates any risk of SQL injection via the username field. Added basic validation for username and password.

**Security Notes:** Implement verify_password() and generate_token() securely. Use HTTPS and secure cookie/session handling.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with special characters in username; expect 400.
- Simulate SQL injection payload; ensure it fails.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of MongoDB's $where operator with string interpolation. Replaced with a direct equality filter {'name': name}, which prevents injection. Added alphanumeric validation on the 'name' parameter.

**Security Notes:** If regular expressions are needed, use re.escape() on input. Limit returned fields to those necessary.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Query for existing and non-existing users; verify correct results.
- Inject JavaScript in 'name'; expect HTTP 400.

---

### 7. web5/src/insert.py
**Vulnerability:** WEAK_CRYPTOGRAPHY  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced storing plain-text passwords with bcrypt password hashing. Generated a unique salt for each password. Used a parameterized query to insert values, preventing SQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Ensure bcrypt is installed (pip install bcrypt). Enforce password policies. Never store or log plaintext passwords.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify that the users table now contains 'password_hash' rather than plain text.
- Attempt to login using verify_password() with known credentials against the hashed values.

---
