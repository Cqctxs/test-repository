## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary code from HTTP POST request without any sanitization or authorization checks leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization on critical money transfer operations; relies on unsecured local PHP server for account data and transactions allowing arbitrary fund manipulation by anyone.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or validation on update to accounts.json allowing anyone to modify balances and perform unauthorized transfers.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability via unsanitized username input in SQL query string allowing unauthorized database access.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability via unsanitized username input in SQL query string allowing unauthorized database access.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses $where queries with user input to MongoDB, which may lead to injection vulnerabilities if inputs are not sanitized properly. Potential exposure of feature flags.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Contains database initialization including a product labeled 'FLAG' that is is_published=0, could be exposed if filters bypass is_published checks.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Contains database initialization script with no direct external interaction; low risk but sensitive if database credentials exposed.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Replaced direct exec() call on user-provided code with AST parsing to validate and reject potentially dangerous code constructs like imports or exec calls. Completely removed execution step to prevent remote code execution (RCE). Respond with an informative message instead.

**Security Notes:** Never execute user input directly. Use AST parsing or restricted interpreters to analyze code safely. Consider running any necessary code in a sandboxed environment with strict controls. Implement proper authorization to restrict who can submit code.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send various code snippets via POST /execute verifying safe rejection
- Attempt to send imports or system calls to ensure they are blocked
- Verify error messages do not leak internal details

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication with a login route and a decorator to protect the transfer endpoint. The transfer endpoint now checks the logged-in user's session and limits transfers to authorized accounts only, mitigating arbitrary fund manipulation. Removed insecure calls to a local PHP server.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate and authorize before processing sensitive operations like money transfers. Use HTTPS and secure session cookies. Passwords should be hashed and stored securely. Replace simple in-memory user stores with databases. Use tokens or OAuth for API calls.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from functools import wraps
- from flask import session

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoint with correct and incorrect credentials
- Test transfer attempts without login (should be denied)
- Test transfer attempts from unauthorized accounts

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check to restrict updates to authenticated users only. Input validation and sanitization for account IDs and balances were added to prevent malformed or dangerous data. Returned proper HTTP response codes to indicate errors or success.

**Security Notes:** Implement a secure, robust authentication and authorization system for all critical operations. Always validate and sanitize any external input. Use HTTPS. Also consider role-based access control for finer permissions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthenticated access to POST requests (should be denied)
- Test malformed JSON payloads
- Test valid account updates with proper authentication

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation of username into SQL query with parameterized query using cursor.execute with placeholders, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. Avoid string concatenation or manual string formatting for SQL queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal and malicious username inputs to confirm injection is blocked
- Verify application behavior with valid and invalid usernames

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Fixed SQL injection by using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation for the username parameter.

**Security Notes:** Never concatenate or interpolate user input directly into SQL queries. Use parameterized queries or ORM facilities.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test user retrieval with normal and malicious username inputs to verify injection protection

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe use of $where clause with a parameterized query structure and input validation on 'flag_name' parameter to prevent NoSQL injection. Disallowed user input containing special query operators or scripts by allowlisting alphanumeric characters only.

**Security Notes:** Never use $where or JavaScript expressions from user input in MongoDB queries. Always validate and sanitize all inputs and use query builders/operators that do not interpret code.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from bson.objectid import ObjectId

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and invalid flag_name values
- Test attempts to inject malicious NoSQL payloads

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed the initialization of the product labeled 'FLAG' with is_published=0 to prevent accidental exposure. Instead, such sensitive products should be managed separately with access controls.

**Security Notes:** Sensitive or unpublished products should not be exposed in general product listings or initialization scripts. Implement role-based access controls to hide sensitive features or data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify that 'FLAG' product does not appear in public API or database initializations
- Test with users with and without admin roles to confirm visibility controls

---
