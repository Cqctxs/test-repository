## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (6)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-submitted code via exec, allowing remote code execution.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses os.system without input sanitization and proxies requests to gateway.php without authentication, potential command injection and business logic abuse.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No authentication or input validation on financial transfers, allows arbitrary account manipulation and mass update of JSON file.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where with unescaped user input, allowing NoSQL injection and remote data access.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL queries with unsanitized user input, prone to SQL injection.

#### 6. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Identical SQL injection vulnerability in login endpoint via f-string in SQLite query.


### Medium Risk Files (0)


### Low Risk Files (2)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Initialization script with no external input, low exposure.

#### 2. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Populates SQLite database with seed data, no external input and no sensitive operations.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced use of exec on user-provided code with a safe AST-based evaluator that only supports numeric operations. Disallowed arbitrary code execution by whitelisting AST nodes and operators.

**Security Notes:** - Avoid using exec/eval on untrusted input.  
- If you must allow more operations, carefully extend the AST whitelist.  
- Set Flask debug=False in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator as op

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid math expressions and verify correct results.
- Attempt injection payloads (e.g. __import__('os').system) and confirm they're blocked.

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** COMMAND_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed os.system call and replaced with Python requests to forward JSON payload. Implemented session-based authentication and URL allowlist to prevent unauthorized or dangerous commands.

**Security Notes:** - Always validate and sanitize external URLs.  
- Use HTTPS and verify certificates.  
- Store session secret in environment variable.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to call /proxy without login and expect redirect.
- Try invalid URL prefixes and expect 400.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check, input sanitization with filter_var, numeric validation for amount, existence and balance checks, atomic file write with temporary file.

**Security Notes:** - Use HTTPS and secure session cookies.  
- Rotate session IDs after login.  
- Consider moving from JSON file to a database with transactions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt transfer without login, expect 401.
- Try negative or nonnumeric amount, expect 400.
- Test concurrent transfers for race conditions.

---

### 4. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of $where and string concatenation. Accept only valid ObjectId as path parameter and query by _id field, preventing injection.

**Security Notes:** - Never use $where with untrusted input.  
- Always validate and coerce types for query parameters.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from bson.objectid import ObjectId

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Request with invalid user_id, expect 400.
- Attempt injection payload, ensure no unauthorized data returned.

---

### 5. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized query using SQLite's '?' placeholders. Added length check on input.

**Security Notes:** - Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection.  
- Limit user input size to avoid DoS.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try SQL payloads in 'q' parameter and verify no injection.

---

### 6. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed raw f-string SQL to parameterized query with '?' placeholders to eliminate injection. Added basic null checks.

**Security Notes:** - Never store plaintext passwords; use salted hashes (e.g. bcrypt).  
- Consider implementing rate-limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with injection strings and ensure failure.
