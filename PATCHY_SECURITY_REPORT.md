## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Contains usage of 'exec' on user-provided code which leads to arbitrary code execution vulnerability, allowing attackers to execute any code on the server.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Updates 'accounts.json' without any authentication or authorization checks, allowing arbitrary modification of account balances and potential abuse.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on unsecured PHP backend for account balance and transaction handling with insufficient validation, and no authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized money transfers.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query with user input.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query with user input.


### Medium Risk Files (3)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB queries with '$where' and string formatting that may lead to injection attacks; no authentication or access controls implemented, exposing product and category data.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Database initializer inserts a special product containing the FLAG in description without access controls; could leak sensitive information if published or accessed improperly.

#### 3. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains plaintext user credentials with dummy flag, but represents test or sample data for database seeding; moderate risk if used in production.


### Low Risk Files (0)


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the use of 'exec' on user input with a safe evaluation function 'safe_eval' that only allows basic mathematical expressions using a whitelist of allowed AST nodes and operators. This prevents arbitrary code execution by sanitizing and restricting what code can be run from user input.

**Security Notes:** Avoid executing user input directly. Use safe parsing or evaluation libraries. Always whitelist allowed operations or commands and never use exec or eval with untrusted data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and invalid math expressions.
- Verify that code injection attempts fail and return errors.
- Perform security scans to confirm exec usage is removed.

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added authentication and authorization checks: only users logged in as admins can update account balances. Added input sanitization and validation to avoid invalid data and secure account keys. Returns appropriate error codes and messages for robustness.

**Security Notes:** Always enforce access control before modifying sensitive data. Validate all inputs to prevent data corruption or injection vulnerabilities. Use proper session management for authentication.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized access is denied.
- Test authorized admin updates succeed.
- Test input validation rejects malformed data.

---

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added authentication with Flask sessions and role-based authorization restricting transfers to logged-in users with 'user' role. Added input validation, error handling, and basic sanitization. Backend PHP requests are placeholders for secure authenticated calls to avoid unauthorized transfers.

**Security Notes:** Never trust frontend or inter-service requests without authentication and authorization. Implement proper user session management and restrict sensitive operations by user role. Validate all inputs strictly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, session

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid/invalid credentials.
- Test unauthorized transfer attempts are rejected.
- Test valid transfers succeed and balances update accordingly.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string formatting of SQL queries with parameterized queries using '?' placeholders and parameter tuple. This prevents SQL injection by not allowing user input to alter query syntax.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for SQL queries. Avoid directly concatenating user input into SQL commands.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3
- from flask import Flask, request, g, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal and malicious usernames including SQL injection attempts to confirm they fail safely.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced vulnerable string formatting in the SQL query with parameterized query. This secures the code against SQL injection attacks by ensuring user input is passed as parameter, not as query text.

**Security Notes:** Never concatenate or format SQL command strings with user input. Always use parameterized queries or access ORM methods.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, g

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection via username parameter to confirm protection.
- Validate normal queries work correctly.

## üìã Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Backup existing files and database.
- Test environment setup replicating production.
- Ensure all dependencies for Flask, sqlite3, etc. are installed.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy code fix to web2/exec/app.py**
   - Command: `git checkout -b safe-eval-fix && git commit -am 'Fix exec vulnerability'`
   - Verification: Manually test calculation endpoint rejects unsafe code

2. **Deploy code fix to web3/param/gateway.php**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Add auth checks to gateway.php'`
   - Verification: Attempt update with and without admin session; unauthorized blocked

3. **Deploy code fix to web3/param/app.py**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Add auth and input validation in transfers'`
   - Verification: Test login and transfer functionality; unauthorized returns 403

4. **Deploy code fix to web5/dist/app.py**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Parameterize SQL queries to fix injection'`
   - Verification: Test user lookup endpoint with input containing SQL injection payloads

5. **Deploy code fix to web5/src/app.py**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Parameterize SQL queries to fix injection'`
   - Verification: Test search endpoint with malicious inputs to confirm mitigation


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.
- Review error logs for injection attempt traces.
- Monitor application performance for issues post fix.
- Implement alerting for security exceptions or failures.

## üöÄ Next Steps
