## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code from user input without any sanitization, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Unsanitized user input is forwarded in POST request to PHP backend without authentication or validation, allowing potential unauthorized actions or fund transfers.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization checks; allows anyone to read and modify accounts.json which can be exploited for unauthorized fund transfers.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string interpolation of user input into SQL query without parameterization.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string interpolation of user input into SQL query without parameterization.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB queries with '$where' and string interpolation that can be unsafe if input is not sanitized, could lead to NoSQL injection. No visible authentication or access control.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Stores sensitive flag in database accessible via published API without access control. Public API potentially exposes sensitive data if products marked as published include secrets.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Script to insert sample data into SQLite database. No immediate security risk, but user passwords stored in plaintext.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code executed arbitrary Python code from user input directly using 'exec' or 'eval', which is an extreme security risk leading to remote code execution. The fixed code removes any use of 'exec' or 'eval' with user input. Instead, it implements a safe expression evaluator that only allows a limited set of arithmetic operations, parsing the input expression into an abstract syntax tree and evaluating it only if it contains safe nodes and operators. This prevents execution of arbitrary code while keeping the original functionality of evaluating expressions.

**Security Notes:** Always avoid executing user input as code. Parsing and evaluating expressions safely using AST with strict allowed operations prevents code injection. Consider further input validation or restrict functionality to safe predefined operations if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid arithmetic expressions to ensure correct results
- Test with potentially malicious inputs like injection attempts to verify no code execution occurs
- Test with malformed expressions to check proper error handling

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code forwarded unsanitized user input in POST requests to a PHP backend without any authentication or validation, allowing unauthorized or malicious fund transfers. The fixed code implements basic token-based authentication, requiring a bearer token in the Authorization header to ensure only authorized clients can perform transfers. It validates input types and simple constraints before forwarding to the backend, reducing risk of injection or invalid data.

**Security Notes:** Implement proper authentication and authorization to control access. Always validate inputs before forwarding them to downstream services to avoid injection or malformed data. Use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit. Replace hardcoded tokens with a secure token management or identity system.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- requests
- flask.abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test requests without authorization header and expect 401
- Test with invalid tokens and expect 403
- Test with valid tokens but malformed input and expect 400 errors
- Test valid requests and verify backend calls succeed

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original PHP gateway allowed anyone to read and modify 'accounts.json' without any authentication or authorization, enabling unauthorized fund transfers or data disclosure. The fix adds session-based user authentication, validates inputs, and enforces authorization checks so users can only access and modify accounts they own. It denies unauthorized operations and uses proper HTTP status codes.

**Security Notes:** Use session management or token authentication to restrict API access. Always check user permissions before allowing reads or modifications. Sanitize and validate all inputs from clients. Consider better data storage with database and access controls rather than flat JSON files for sensitive data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test API requests without session and expect 401 Unauthorized
- Test access to unauthorized accounts and expect access denied
- Test valid authenticated requests and verify correct account data is returned or modified
- Test invalid input and verify error handling

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code interpolated user input directly into the SQL query string, which exposed the application to SQL Injection attacks. The fixed code uses a parameterized SQL query with placeholders ('?') and passes user input as parameters, which safely escapes inputs and prevents malicious query manipulation while retaining original functionality.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with SQL databases. Never concatenate or interpolate untrusted user input directly into SQL commands. Use database libraries that support parameterized queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test API with various user_id values including special characters and SQL keywords to ensure no injection possible
- Test with valid and invalid user IDs

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used unsafe string interpolation into the SQL query with user input, opening a SQL Injection vulnerability. The fix replaces this with a parameterized query using '?' placeholders and passing the user input as a parameter tuple, ensuring the database driver escapes inputs properly and preventing injection attacks. This preserves the original functionality of filtering items by category.

**Security Notes:** Always prefer parameterized queries over string formatting for database calls with user input. Validate inputs for expected data types and constraints when possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test requests with normal and malicious category inputs to verify no injection occurs
- Test results filtering by category
