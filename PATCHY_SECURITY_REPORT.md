## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-supplied code via exec(), leading to remote code execution

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Reveals FLAG based on account balance without proper authentication or authorization; uses os.system call

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB '$where' queries with string interpolation, vulnerable to NoSQL injection

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL query via f-string with unsanitized user input, vulnerable to SQL injection

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL query via f-string with unsanitized user input, vulnerable to SQL injection


### Medium Risk Files (1)

#### 1. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Updates JSON file based on POST parameters without validation, allowing unauthorized balance manipulation


### Low Risk Files (2)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script; no direct user input handling at runtime

#### 2. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Data seeding script; no runtime exposure to external input


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed exec() and replaced with a safe AST-based evaluator. We validate the AST nodes against a whitelist and execute only numeric and allowed math functions in a restricted environment without builtins.

**Security Notes:** Using AST whitelisting prevents arbitrary code execution. Always validate the AST and restrict globals and builtins.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Submit valid numeric expressions
- Attempt injection payloads such as `__import__("os").system("ls")` and confirm rejection

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added token-based authentication, parameterized database queries, and input validation. Only authorized requests with correct API_TOKEN can transfer funds or retrieve the flag. Also ensure `amount` is numeric and positive.

**Security Notes:** Store API_TOKEN as an environment variable. Use HTTPS in production and rotate tokens periodically.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt unauthenticated access and expect 401
- Use valid token and insufficient balance to expect 403
- Retrieve flag with sufficient balance

---

### 3. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of `$where` with string interpolation. Now using a standard dict filter for username and password, which prevents NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Passwords should be hashed with bcrypt; this code is illustrative.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection payloads in username/password
- Use valid credentials to confirm login success

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced f-string SQL with parameterized query and validated that user_id is numeric.

**Security Notes:** Always validate inputs and use parameterized queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try `user_id=1 OR 1=1` and ensure it fails
- Fetch valid and invalid IDs

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Switched from f-string to psycopg2 parameterized query. Added basic alphanumeric validation for username.

**Security Notes:** Consider stronger validation or normalization for usernames.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection payloads
- Request valid and invalid usernames

---

### 6. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added API key authorization, JSON parsing, and strict validation for `account` and `amount`. Prevents unauthorized modifications and invalid data.

**Security Notes:** Store API_KEY in environment. Consider migrating from flat file to a database for integrity and concurrency.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call without API key
- Send invalid JSON
- Update valid and invalid accounts

---


## üìã Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Access to environment variable store
- Backups of current code and databases

### Deployment Steps

1. **Merge security fixes branch into staging**
   - Command: `git checkout staging && git merge security-fixes`
   - Verification: All unit tests pass

2. **Deploy to staging environment**
   - Command: `deploy.sh staging`
   - Verification: Smoke tests and manual checks

3. **Monitor logs for errors**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: No new 4xx/5xx rates

4. **Deploy to production**
   - Command: `deploy.sh production`
   - Verification: Production health metrics stable


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor for increased 4xx errors on endpoints
- Review authentication failure logs
- Verify no injection anomalies

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review each security issue carefully** - Understand the vulnerability and proposed fix
2. **Test the fixes in a development environment** - Ensure functionality is preserved
3. **Apply fixes in priority order** - Start with high-confidence, high-impact fixes
4. **Update dependencies** - Install any additional required packages
5. **Run security tests** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Deploy to production** - Follow your standard deployment process
7. **Monitor for issues** - Watch logs and metrics after deployment
