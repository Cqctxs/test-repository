## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-provided code without any sanitization, leading to code injection and remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Directly modifies accounts balance from POST data without authentication or validation, allowing unauthorized manipulation of account balances.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on untrusted responses from gateway.php for account data and sends POST requests adding sender info without authorization controls, enabling possible unauthorized transactions and logic bypass.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection risk due to user input embedded directly into SQL query without sanitization in login endpoint.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection risk due to user input embedded directly into SQL query without sanitization in login endpoint.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB with $where clause and string concatenation from user inputs in filter_products endpoint, which risks NoSQL injection and unauthorized data exposure.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Contains initialization code with FLAG storage and database configuration; although not directly vulnerable, exposure of FLAG in product data and environment variables is sensitive.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Script inserts predefined user data into SQLite database; low risk as it uses parameterized queries and runs offline.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Replaced direct execution of arbitrary user code using exec with a restricted environment that disables builtins and prevents use of dangerous keywords. This prevents code injection and remote code execution by blocking unsafe code and limiting execution context.

**Security Notes:** Code injection and remote code execution risks are mitigated by rejecting unsafe keywords and executing user code without builtins, which limits what code can perform. Further improvements include sandboxing or using a whitelist of safe operations, or evaluating expressions with ast.literal_eval if applicable.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test attempts to run malicious code snippets are blocked
- Verify normal allowed code can run successfully
- Test that code execution environment does not have access to restricted modules or operations

---

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added server-side authorization checks to ensure only authenticated users with 'admin' role can modify account balances. Sanitized and validated POST inputs. Used prepared SQL statements to prevent injection risks.

**Security Notes:** Authorization is required before sensitive actions like balance modification. Input validation prevents malformed or malicious data. Using prepared statements prevents SQL injection. Session management must securely identify user roles.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized users cannot update balances
- Test input validation blocks invalid input
- Test successful balance update with authorized users

---

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added authorization check verifying that the user sending the request is allowed to act on behalf of the sender account. Authentication via request header is used as an example and should be replaced with proper authentication session management. Input type validation was added. Calls to gateway.php remain but authorization is enforced before forwarding requests.

**Security Notes:** Always verify that requests come from authenticated and authorized users when performing sensitive operations. Avoid trusting untrusted endpoints without authorization. Implement proper identity and access management in production environments.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, abort
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized send attempts are rejected
- Test valid send attempts succeed
- Test invalid data input is rejected

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed raw SQL query concatenating username and password directly into a parameterized query using placeholders and tuple parameters. This prevents SQL injection by safely handling user input.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases with user input. Never concatenate user data into SQL queries directly. Passwords should be hashed and verified with a secure hash function (bcrypt, Argon2).

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify normal login succeeds
- Test SQL injection attacks fail
- Test missing parameters handled gracefully

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Refactored login SQL query to use parameterized query with placeholders to prevent SQL injection. Inputs are passed as parameters instead of concatenating into the query string.

**Security Notes:** Parameterized queries prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL through user inputs. Password handling can be improved further by storing hashed passwords.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test invalid and valid usernames and passwords
- Validate that SQL injection attempts fail

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed usage of $where which runs arbitrary JavaScript and can cause NoSQL injection by enabling code injection from user input. Replaced with direct field matching using sanitized, validated parameters and typed checks. Used allowlist regex to validate category input.

**Security Notes:** Avoid $where in MongoDB queries involving user input. Always sanitize and validate query parameters. Avoid building query filters by concatenating strings or direct injection of user data in query operators.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- from pymongo import MongoClient
- from bson.objectid import ObjectId
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid category filtering
- Test price range filtering
- Test injection attempts with special characters fail
