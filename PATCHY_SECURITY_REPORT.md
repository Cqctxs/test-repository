## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses exec() on user-submitted code without sandboxing, allowing arbitrary code execution (Remote Code Execution vulnerability).

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization checks on sending money; sender hardcoded and recipient controlled by user, allows unauthorized money transfer and possible balance manipulation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No validation or authorization on updating account balances; trusting POST data can lead to arbitrary balance changes and account takeover.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability: unsanitized user input directly interpolated into SQL query.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability: unsanitized user input directly interpolated into SQL query.


### Medium Risk Files (1)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with string interpolation which could allow NoSQL injection if input is not sanitized.


### Low Risk Files (2)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script inserting sample data, including a hidden FLAG entry; no direct vulnerabilities in code but includes sensitive info in database.

#### 2. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization inserting sample users; no direct vulnerability but stores passwords in plaintext.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed direct usage of exec() on user-submitted code. Instead, parsed the input code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to vet potentially dangerous constructs like import statements and calls to exec or eval. The code now restricts allowed built-in functions and prevents dynamic importing or arbitrary code execution, mitigating Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities.

**Security Notes:** Restricting allowed builtins and disallowing import statements prevents many attack vectors. Consider further sandboxing or code analysis for production use. Logging execution attempts and enforcing timeouts can improve security. Avoid verbose error output revealing system internals.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import traceback

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test execution of safe, valid Python code snippets to confirm functionality.
- Test attempt to import modules or call disallowed functions and verify rejection.
- Test submission of malicious code snippets and ensure no server compromise or crashes.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added authentication and session management via Flask sessions. Sender is dynamically determined based on the logged-in user session rather than hardcoded. Added authorization checks to prevent unauthorized money transfers. Input validation for recipient existence and transfer amount added to prevent balance manipulations.

**Security Notes:** Ensure the secret key is a secure random value in production. Use HTTPS to protect session cookies. Implement password hashing instead of storing plaintext passwords. Extend user management mechanism for production readiness.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login and logout workflows.
- Test money transfer as an authenticated user succeeds.
- Test money transfer without authentication is rejected.
- Test invalid recipients and amounts are properly rejected.
- Test sender balance correctly updated after transfers.

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication to ensure only authenticated users can update their balance. Removed trust of POST data controlling arbitrary account selection. Now the logged-in user's balance is modified, preventing account takeover risk. Input validation on numeric and positive amount enforced.

**Security Notes:** In production, user data and balances should be stored in a secure database. Passwords and authentication should be based on secure mechanisms. Communication should use HTTPS to protect session cookies. Proper session expiration and token handling are important.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test balance update for authenticated users succeeds.
- Test unauthorized users cannot update balance.
- Test invalid amount values result in error.
- Test session timeout or invalidation prevents further updates.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed SQL query to use a parameterized query with a placeholder and passing user input as a separate parameter to avoid direct string interpolation. This protects against SQL Injection attacks by ensuring the database engine treats user input strictly as data, not executable code.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Validate and sanitize input where appropriate. Use ORM frameworks when possible for safer database abstractions.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test fetching user by username returns correct data.
- Test with malicious input to confirm SQL injection is not possible.
- Test error handling for non-existent users.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced direct string interpolation in SQL query with a parameterized query using placeholders and parameters passed separately. This prevents SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data only. Added wildcards to support LIKE searches as per original functionality.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries to prevent injection. Validate input length and type as needed to prevent abuse. Consider using full-text search features with proper sanitization.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test searching with normal keywords returns expected users.
- Test input with SQL meta-characters does not cause injection or errors.
- Test empty or missing keywords handled gracefully.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed usage of $where with string interpolation, replacing it with safe regex query on a specific field with user input sanitized and length-limited. This prevents NoSQL injection attacks where attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code in $where. Also validated input is string and constrained length to reduce attack surface.

**Security Notes:** Avoid dynamic JavaScript execution in NoSQL queries via $where with user input. Use explicit query operators ($regex, $eq, etc.) with validated inputs. Implement rate-limiting and authentication to further secure endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test search works with valid and partial names.
- Test attempts to inject invalid queries are blocked or sanitized.
- Test response format remains consistent.
