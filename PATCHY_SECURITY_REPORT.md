## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code from user input without sanitization, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses external requests to a local PHP gateway for critical financial operations without authentication or authorization; relies on client side validation and manipulates accounts via PHP script susceptible to unauthorized modifications.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Modifies account balances based on user input without any authentication or authorization checks, allowing arbitrary manipulation of account balances and potential theft or inflation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses SQL query with unsanitized user input in f-string leading to SQL Injection vulnerability.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses SQL query with unsanitized user input in f-string leading to SQL Injection vulnerability.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** MongoDB queries use $where with stringified JavaScript, which can lead to NoSQL injection if user input is not sanitized. Although no direct user input seen here, risky pattern is used.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Database initialization script injecting 'FLAG' directly into the database with is_published=0 could lead to sensitive data exposure if published flag is improperly handled later.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Initializes SQLite DB and inserts sample users with plaintext passwords; lacks password hashing but less immediately exploitable.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the use of direct exec() or eval() on user input with AST parsing in 'eval' mode, which only permits expressions. This avoids executing arbitrary statements and disables access to Python built-ins by providing an empty '__builtins__' dictionary, preventing remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**Security Notes:** Avoid executing arbitrary user-provided code. Using the 'ast' module to parse and only allow expressions increases safety. For production, consider sandboxing or using restricted execution environments.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with malicious inputs containing dangerous Python statements to verify execution is blocked.
- Test with legitimate expressions to verify correct evaluation.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added proper authentication and authorization in the Python app before calling the PHP gateway. Implemented login with session management, checked user role before performing critical operation, and sent secure server-side authentication tokens to the PHP endpoint. This prevents unauthorized access relying on client-side validation.

**Security Notes:** Never trust client-side validation alone for critical operations. Implement robust authentication and authorization on the server side and communicate with backends using secure tokens or session credentials. Use secure password storage and session management.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests
- from flask import session, abort

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt unauthorized operation to verify access is denied.
- Verify successful login provides access as expected.
- Test token validation between app.py and gateway.php.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication and authorization checks to verify that only admins can update account balances. Implemented input validation and sanitization. Used prepared statements with PDO to securely update database and prevent SQL injection. Added appropriate HTTP response codes and error handling.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate and authorize before performing critical operations. Sanitize and validate all user inputs. Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection. Configure session securely and use HTTPS in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized requests are rejected with 403.
- Test valid requests modify balances correctly.
- Test SQL Injection attempts fail.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation for SQL query with parameterized query using '?' placeholders provided by sqlite3's execute method. Also validated user input to accept only digit strings for user_id. This prevents SQL Injection attacks where malicious SQL could be injected via user_id.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database queries involving user input. Validate and sanitize user inputs. Avoid direct string concatenation or formatting in queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal user_id values.
- Attempt SQL Injection payloads to ensure they fail.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed the direct f-string interpolation of user input in the SQL query to a parameterized query using SQLite's .execute with query placeholders '?'. This prevents SQL Injection by correctly escaping user input. Also added input validation for query parameter missing.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries when incorporating user input in SQL statements. Do input validation and escaping as an extra layer.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify input with normal strings returns expected data.
- Test various SQL injection attempts (e.g., escaping characters) have no effect.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed the use of the $where operator which executes JavaScript code inside MongoDB and replaced it with a direct key-value match query. Added strict input validation with isalnum check to allow only alphanumeric names which prevents injection of malicious JavaScript expressions.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using $where or JavaScript execution in MongoDB queries with unsanitized user input. Always prefer query builders or direct key matching. Validate and sanitize user inputs strictly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test normal name inputs return correct results.
- Attempt injections with JavaScript-like inputs to verify no execution.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed insertion of plain FLAG directly into the database. Instead, encrypted the flag using Fernet symmetric encryption before inserting into the database. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data if is_published is mishandled. The encryption key should be stored securely and not hardcoded in production.

**Security Notes:** Sensitive data should never be stored in plaintext in databases. Use encryption and restrict access along with proper access control. Use environment variables or secure key management for encryption keys.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify that the stored value is encrypted and not plaintext.
- Attempt to fetch flag without key and ensure data cannot be read.
