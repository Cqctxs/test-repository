## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes user-submitted code directly using exec(), leading to arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Lacks input validation and proper authorization, allows manipulation of accounts.json leading to unauthorized money transfers.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on untrusted external PHP backend without proper authentication; hardcoded username ('Eatingfood') assumed trustworthy; insufficient validation exposes money transfer abuse and possible unauthorized fund access.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query using user input directly.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query using user input directly.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with JavaScript expressions; can lead to injection if user-provided data is not sanitized.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains data seeding with a secret flag stored in database but not well protected; potential exposure if published product is accessed improperly.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Script to insert sample data; low risk as it doesn't handle user input directly.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed the dangerous use of exec() which executes arbitrary Python code submitted by the user. Instead, implemented a safe expression evaluator using ast module that parses and only allows numeric and arithmetic expressions, blocking code execution risks.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using eval()/exec() with user input. Use restricted evaluators like ast.literal_eval where possible. For any code execution features, implement strong sandboxing and validation.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with various malicious inputs containing code injection attempts to verify rejection.
- Test expected arithmetic expressions to verify correct evaluation.

---

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Implemented session-based authorization checking to ensure only authenticated and authorized users (with role 'admin') can perform money transfers. Added input validation and sanitization on accounts and amount parameters. Added error handling for missing/invalid inputs, non-existent accounts, and insufficient funds to prevent unauthorized money manipulation.

**Security Notes:** Always enforce authentication and strict authorization for sensitive operations such as money transfers. Sanitize and validate all user input and enforce proper error handling and HTTP response codes.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test transfer with unauthorized session and verify access denied.
- Test transfer with invalid inputs and verify proper error messages.
- Test normal transfer flow for correctness.

---

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added proper session-based authentication enforcing login and controlling access to the money transfer endpoint. Removed reliance on hardcoded username trust. Implemented input validation for transfer parameters. Added error handling for backend communication failures. The backend authorization should also be improved correspondingly.

**Security Notes:** Use strong session management and authentication for user endpoints. Validate all inputs and avoid trusting external systems blindly. Ensure backend calls are authenticated and authorized. Protect secret keys and do not hardcode in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import Flask, request, session, jsonify
- import requests

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoint with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test transfer endpoint without login returns 401.
- Test transfer with valid session and invalid amounts returns error.
- Test integration with backend service.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe string formatting in SQL query with parameterized query using placeholders and passing user input as parameter. This prevents SQL injection by properly escaping user input.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for any database queries involving user input. Never concatenate or format user input directly into SQL queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with malicious user id input (e.g., SQL syntax) to verify query is safe.
- Test normal queries to confirm correct results.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe string interpolation in SQL query with parameterized query. psycopg2's execute method is used with parameter tuple to securely include user input, preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries and never embed user input directly into SQL strings. Use database adapters' parameter substitution features consistently.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import psycopg2

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with SQL injection strings in user_id to verify safe handling.
- Test regular queries for correctness.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed use of MongoDB $where clause with user input, which executes JavaScript and is vulnerable to injection. Instead, used a safe query with $regex and validated input for expected format. This prevents arbitrary code execution in database queries.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using $where or any JavaScript evaluation in NoSQL queries with untrusted input. Use proper query operators and sanitize inputs carefully.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test input with malicious JavaScript injection strings and verify no execution occurs.
- Test with valid input for correct search results.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed hardcoded secret flags that may be exposed. Added comments about securing secrets using environment variables or secret vault solutions and added metadata for access control. This reduces risk of accidental exposure of sensitive data.

**Security Notes:** Never hardcode secrets in source code. Use secret stores or environment variables with restricted access. Sanitize debug logs and database exports to exclude secrets.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify that secrets are not exposed in logs or database exports.
- Verify application accesses secrets correctly from secure source.
