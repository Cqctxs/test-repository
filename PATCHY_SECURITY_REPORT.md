## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes user-submitted code directly via exec() allowing arbitrary code execution, leading to remote code execution vulnerabilities.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization; allows sending money with minimal validation; hardcoded 'Eatingfood' user; potential insecure interactions with PHP gateway allowing unauthorized fund transfers.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or validation on POST requests; allows arbitrary modification of accounts.json, enabling unauthorized fund manipulations.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to string formatting user input directly into SQL query without sanitization.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to string formatting user input directly into SQL query without sanitization.


### Medium Risk Files (3)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB with user-provided filters using $where clause, potentially allowing injection of JavaScript code in queries if user input is not sanitized properly.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive sample data including a secret FLAG in product description that is published only if is_published flag changed; potential sensitive information leakage if logic is bypassed.

#### 3. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sample database initialization with user credentials but no direct vulnerability; important for context but medium risk due to sample secrets.


### Low Risk Files (0)


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original app.py directly executed user-submitted code using exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution. The fix replaces this with a safer evaluation approach using Python's AST module to parse the user input and only allow a restricted subset of safe expressions (arithmetic and simple constants). This prevents execution of arbitrary code and mitigates remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**Security Notes:** Using AST parsing and checking allowed nodes ensures that only safe Python expressions are executed. The use of eval() is controlled tightly with no built-ins and an empty globals dict. Further hardening can involve using sandboxing or dedicated expression evaluators.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test execution of safe arithmetic expressions (e.g., '1 + 2 * 3').
- Test rejection of unsafe code (e.g., 'import os', '__import__("os")', 'open("file")').
- Test boundary cases like empty input or large expressions.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** This fix adds basic authentication and session management to the app, removing the hardcoded 'Eatingfood' user access. Only logged-in users can send money, with input validation and balance checks to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transfers.

**Security Notes:** This example uses in-memory user data and Flask session cookies with a secure random secret key. For production, use a database and secure HTTPS. Passwords are hashed using werkzeug's generate_password_hash. Always validate and sanitize inputs.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
- import os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test protected endpoints without authentication returns 403.
- Test sending money with insufficient balance.
- Test sending money to non-existent user.
- Test session persistence across requests.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** This fix adds session-based authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access to the gateway.php POST endpoint that modifies accounts.json. It validates input, checks sender balance, and verifies the target account before processing transfers to mitigate unauthorized fund manipulation.

**Security Notes:** For production use, consider stronger authentication mechanisms, input sanitization, and concurrency controls for file access to accounts.json. Use HTTPS for secure session handling and data transmission.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test access to POST without logged in session returns 403.
- Test transfers with invalid data return proper errors.
- Test transfers with insufficient funds are rejected.
- Test successful transfers update accounts.json correctly.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code directly formatted user input into SQL query strings, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. The fixed code uses parameterized queries with placeholders `?` and passes parameters as a tuple, preventing injection.

**Security Notes:** Always validate input types where possible (e.g., check if user_id is digit). Use parameterized queries for all database interactions involving user input.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and invalid user IDs.
- Test for SQL injection attempts like '1 OR 1=1'.
- Test behavior when user not found.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code formatted user input directly into the SQL statement causing SQL injection risk. The fix uses parameterized queries with placeholders and passes parameters separately to prevent injection, specifically for LIKE search.

**Security Notes:** Use input validation for search queries if applicable. Always prefer parameterized queries. For more complex search, consider full-text search engines.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test search functionality with normal and wildcard characters.
- Attempt SQL injection payloads to verify they do not succeed.
- Test empty and very long queries.

   - Verification: Test login, session management, and money transfer endpoints for correct permissions.

3. **Secure gateway.php with session-based authentication**

   - Verification: Attempt to post funds transfer without login, verify 403 response; perform valid authenticated transfers.

4. **Fix SQL Injection in web5/dist/app.py by parameterizing queries**

   - Verification: Test user fetch endpoint using normal and injection payloads; verify no unauthorized query results.

5. **Fix SQL Injection in web5/src/app.py with parameterized LIKE queries**
   - Command: `Replace app.py with fixed code`
   - Verification: Test search endpoint for normal and malicious inputs; verify no injection.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor application logs for suspicious requests and authentication failures.
- Monitor transaction logs for unusual account activity.
- Enable alerting on failed SQL or code execution attempts.
- Regularly audit user session and token management logs.
