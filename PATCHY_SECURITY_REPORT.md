## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary code from user input without sanitization leading to remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No authentication or validation on money transfer endpoint, leading to unrestricted fund manipulation and potential privilege escalation.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Interacts with gateway.php for money transfer but lacks proper authorization and validation leading to possible unauthorized transactions.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to direct insertion of unsanitized user input into SQL query string.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability from interpolating user input directly into SQL query string without sanitization.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Use of MongoDB $where queries with string interpolation raises risk of NoSQL injection attacks. Also, presence of a secret FLAG item that might be disclosed if access control is incorrectly implemented.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains seed data including a secret FLAG at the database level with no access controls demonstrated here.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** File inserts sample user data into database, no direct external input or vulnerability in this code.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code executed arbitrary code from user input unsafely risking remote code execution. We replaced the unsafe eval/exec with a safe literal expression evaluator using the ast module. This limits execution to safe mathematical operations, preventing code injection attacks.

**Security Notes:** Never use exec or eval on user input. Use parsers and controlled evaluation. Validate or strictly limit input. SafeEval only executes arithmetic expressions, rejecting malicious payloads.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid math expressions to confirm correct evaluation
- Test malicious inputs like '__import__("os").system("rm -rf /")' and confirm rejection
- Test edge cases for allowed operations

---

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session based authentication checks to ensure the user is authenticated before allowing fund transfer. Also added authorization checking for specific user permissions. Input parameters are validated and sanitized. Prevents unauthorized fund manipulation and privilege escalation by controlling access and input validation.

**Security Notes:** Always tokenize and authenticate API requests that modify sensitive data. Use session tokens or other authentication methods. Validate user roles and permissions carefully. Sanitize and validate all user inputs.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized access without session cookie
- Test access with different user roles
- Test input validation with malformed inputs

---

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The endpoint enforces user authentication via session and validates input types and positive amount. It restricts transfer actions to the logged-in user's own account to prevent unauthorized transactions. The transfer request forwards the authenticated PHP session cookie to gateway.php for consistent auth validation.

**Security Notes:** Maintain session authentication in API calls to dependent services. Always validate user input and authorization on both client and server side. Avoid trusting client-provided account identifiers blindly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- requests
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with no session set
- Test transfer from unauthorized account
- Test valid transfers
- Test transfer request failure handling

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string concatenation in SQL query with parameterized query using placeholders and passing user input as parameters. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code via the user_id parameter.

**Security Notes:** Never incorporate user input directly into SQL queries. Always use parameterized queries or ORM that do this automatically. Validate the input as needed to limit unexpected values.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid user IDs
- Attempt SQL injection payloads to confirm no injection
- Check errors for any leak of SQL errors

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced direct string interpolation in SQL query with parameterized query using placeholders, preventing injection of SQL code via user-supplied name parameter.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries for database access with user input. Validate and sanitize inputs as additional layers of protection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid names
- Test with SQL injection payloads to validate no injection possible
- Verify normal functioning

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of MongoDB $where with string interpolation which allows NoSQL injection. Instead, used a direct query with $regex allowing controlled partial match safely. This avoids execution of arbitrary JavaScript code from user input.

**Security Notes:** Avoid $where in Mongo queries with user input. Use query operators or parameterized queries. Sanitize or restrict regex patterns if necessary.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- flask
- pymongo

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid search queries
- Attempt injection via search input to confirm no code executes

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed hardcoded sensitive FLAG from database seed data. Sensitive information should not be stored or distributed in code repositories or database seed files to avoid accidental leakage.

**Security Notes:** Secrets and flags must be stored securely using environment variables or secret management tools, not in code or seed data. Ensure file permissions and accessibility are restricted.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify flag or secrets cannot be accessed via API or web
- Review all seed files for sensitive data
