## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary code from user input via exec(), allowing arbitrary code execution leading to full server compromise.

#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No input validation/sanitization on POST parameters used directly to update accounts.json, allows manipulation of balances improperly. No authorization checks for money transfers.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Trusts PHP gateway to handle money transfers without authentication or authorization. Allows anyone to manipulate accounts and potentially retrieve sensitive FLAG environment variable via coin balance check.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses SQL queries with string interpolation directly from user input, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses SQL queries with string interpolation directly from user input, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with embedded JavaScript strings from user input potentially, which may lead to injection-like vulnerabilities.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive FLAG data embedded in product list, published status is 0 so not accessible normally, but accidental exposure possible if published flag bypassed.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Script inserts sample users into SQLite database; no direct vulnerabilities but contains credentials.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed use of exec() for direct arbitrary code execution. Instead implemented a safe arithmetic expression evaluator using Python's ast module, which parses and evaluates only arithmetic expressions with a whitelist of allowed operators. This prevents execution of arbitrary code from user input, mitigating code injection risk.

**Security Notes:** Avoid use of exec()/eval on user inputs. Use safe parsers or expression evaluators with strict whitelisting. Always validate and sanitize user inputs thoroughly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid arithmetic expressions returns correct results.
- Test with malicious code snippets returns errors, no code execution.
- Test with edge cases (empty input, very large numbers).

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Implemented session-based authentication to ensure only logged in users can update their own account balance. Added input validation to ensure 'balance' POST parameter is numeric and positive. Restricted balance updates to authenticated user's account only to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Security Notes:** Always implement proper authentication and authorization before modifying sensitive data. Validate and sanitize all input data even if authentication is in place. Avoid direct use of user input for critical updates.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthenticated access is denied.
- Test balance update only affects logged in user.
- Test invalid balance values rejected.

---

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication and authorization to restrict balance checks and transfers to logged-in users only. Transfer operation validates recipient existence, positive numeric amount, and sufficient funds before updating balances. Access to the sensitive FLAG environment variable restricted to an admin user. This fixes unauthorized data manipulation and information disclosure.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate and authorize API requests that modify or access sensitive data. Never rely on external services to enforce security without your own checks. Protect sensitive environment variables and ensure only privileged users can access them.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- import os

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login and session creation works.
- Test unauthorized requests denied.
- Test transfer with valid and invalid inputs.
- Test that FLAG is only returned to admin.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL query with parameterized query using '?' placeholders and passing values as parameters. This prevents SQL Injection attacks by separating code and data. Also used context management for connections properly.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection. Never concatenate or interpolate user input into SQL commands. Regularly update database driver libraries and monitor for vulnerabilities.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal and malicious input to /search endpoint.
- Validate no SQL errors or injection exploits possible.
- Assert correct results returned for valid searches.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed string interpolation of user_id into a parameterized query using placeholders and a tuple parameter. Added validation that user_id is a digit before query. This prevents SQL Injection by keeping query syntax separate from user input data.

**Security Notes:** Never interpolate user input directly into SQL queries. Validate inputs for expected types and ranges. Parameterize all queries. Consider using ORM libraries that enforce safe queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test invalid and valid user IDs to ensure proper error handling.
- Test attempted SQL injection strings rejected or return errors.
- Check that valid users can be fetched correctly.

## üìã Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Backup current codebase and databases.
- Set up a testing/staging environment to deploy and verify fixes.
- Ensure environment variables and session management are properly configured.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy fix for web2/exec/app.py to remove exec misuse.**
   - Command: `git apply fix_web2_exec_app_py.patch`
   - Verification: Verify functionality of code execution endpoint and no exec calls.

2. **Deploy fix for web3/param/gateway.php to add authentication and validation.**
   - Command: `git apply fix_web3_param_gateway_php.patch`
   - Verification: Check account updates only allowed for logged in users with valid input.

3. **Deploy fix for web3/param/app.py to add session auth, protect FLAG.**
   - Command: `git apply fix_web3_param_app_py.patch`
   - Verification: Test login, balance retrieval and transfer with proper authorization.

4. **Deploy fix for web5/dist/app.py to use parameterized SQL queries.**
   - Command: `git apply fix_web5_dist_app_py.patch`
   - Verification: Test search functionality against SQL injection attempts.

5. **Deploy fix for web5/src/app.py to use parameterized queries and validate input.**
   - Command: `git apply fix_web5_src_app_py.patch`
   - Verification: Verify user fetch endpoint handles invalid and injection inputs safely.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor error logs for unexpected exceptions after deploy.
- Audit authentication logs for unauthorized access attempts.
- Review usage patterns of critical endpoints for anomalies.
- Continually scan code for similar injection risks.

## üöÄ Next Steps
