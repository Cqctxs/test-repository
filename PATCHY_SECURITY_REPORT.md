## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary code from user input without sanitization, leading to remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. web3/param/app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization; allows arbitrary money sending through HTTP requests with minimal validation; also relies on external PHP gateway with no auth, leading to potential unauthorized fund manipulation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or input validation on POST requests; directly modifies accounts.json allowing unauthorized account balance manipulation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to use of unsanitized string interpolation in SQL query with user input.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to use of unsanitized string interpolation in SQL query with user input.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with string interpolation allowing possible injection; exposes API endpoints without authentication or authorization checks.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive FLAG in the database data; published status controls visibility but flag item is unpublished, potential risk if improperly accessed.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script with no direct security risks but contains user data including dummy passwords.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced arbitrary execution of user input via exec or eval with safe evaluation using ast.literal_eval which only allows Python literals (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts) and prohibits arbitrary code execution. Added input validation to check for the 'code' parameter in JSON. This removes the remote code execution vulnerability while maintaining the ability to process safe expressions.

**Security Notes:** Avoid executing arbitrary code input directly. Use safe parsing/evaluation methods. Always validate and sanitize input. Disable debug mode in production. Consider rate limiting and authentication.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test that safe literals (strings, numbers, lists) are processed correctly.
- Test rejected inputs such as code containing function calls or imports throw errors.
- Verify no arbitrary code execution is possible by testing malicious inputs like '__import__("os").system("ls")'.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Introduced user authentication with hashed passwords and session-based login to enforce identity before allowing money sending. Added input validation for amount and recipient. Removed unauthenticated direct money sending vulnerability and reliance on insecure external PHP gateway. This prevents unauthorized access and controls fund manipulation.

**Security Notes:** Use HTTPS to protect session cookies. Store passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt in production. Use proper authorization scopes for money sending. Protect session cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags. Implement rate limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import hashlib
- import secrets
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoint with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Test that money sending fails if not authenticated.
- Test sending money with invalid parameters.
- Test session expiration and logout scenarios.

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added PHP session-based authentication check to verify the user is logged in before allowing balance manipulations. Added input validation and sanitization for 'account' and 'balance' inputs to prevent injection or invalid data. Secured file write with atomic update and error checking. This prevents unauthorized manipulation of account balances and validates inputs.

**Security Notes:** Ensure sessions are started after login on server. Use HTTPS to secure cookies. Consider role-based access control to restrict who can modify balances. Validate account names against a whitelist or stricter format. Avoid storing balances in JSON files for production systems; use a proper database.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test that updates fail without authentication session.
- Test with invalid and valid input parameters.
- Test account existence validation.
- Test concurrent updates do not corrupt file.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL query with parameterized query using placeholders `?` and passed parameters as a tuple to execute function. Also validated that 'id' is an integer to prevent injection and malformed queries. This prevents attackers from executing arbitrary SQL commands via the 'id' query parameter.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use database user with least privileges. Turn off debug mode in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and invalid user IDs.
- Attempt SQL injection payloads to verify blocking.
- Check that legitimate users retrieve data correctly.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed raw string interpolation in SQL query to parameterized query with '%s' placeholder and parameters passed as tuple. Added input validation ensuring 'id' parameter is an integer. This prevents attackers from injecting SQL code that could compromise the database.

**Security Notes:** Use parameterized queries always when dealing with user inputs in SQL commands. Validate inputs for type and format. Use environment variables or configuration for database credentials, not hardcoded.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import psycopg2
- from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid user ids.
- Attempt SQL injection via 'id' parameter to verify prevention.
- Check no impact on functionality.

## üìã Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Backup current version of all files before applying fixes.
- Review user authentication policies and ensure test accounts exist.
- Ensure development environment to test fixes safely.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Replace web2/exec/app.py with secure version to remove code injection.**
   - Command: `cp fixed_web2_exec_app_py.py web2/exec/app.py`
   - Verification: Test /execute endpoint with safe and unsafe inputs to confirm safe evaluation.

2. **Replace web3/param/app.py with authentication and session management added.**
   - Command: `cp fixed_web3_param_app_py.py web3/param/app.py`
   - Verification: Ensure /login and /send_money endpoints require authentication and validate inputs.

3. **Update web3/param/gateway.php to require authentication and validate inputs.**
   - Command: `cp fixed_web3_param_gateway_php.php web3/param/gateway.php`
   - Verification: Attempt to POST without login and verify rejection, test valid balance update.

4. **Update web5/dist/app.py to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.**
   - Command: `cp fixed_web5_dist_app_py.py web5/dist/app.py`
   - Verification: Test user retrieval with valid and invalid ids, attempt SQL injection.

5. **Update web5/src/app.py to use parameterized queries with PostgreSQL connection.**
   - Command: `cp fixed_web5_src_app_py.py web5/src/app.py`
   - Verification: Test user queries and ensure SQL injection is not possible.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor logs for authentication failures and unusual activities.
- Audit usage of /send_money and account balance updates.
- Enable database query logging to detect anomalous queries.
- Continuously scan endpoints for injection vulnerabilities.
