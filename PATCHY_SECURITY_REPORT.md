## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary Python code from user input without sanitization, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Lacks proper authentication and authorization checks on sending money; relies on client form data without server-side user verification, leading to unauthorized money transfer and privilege escalation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No authentication, no input validation when updating account balances; directly modifies JSON data based on POST input without validation, allowing manipulation of account funds.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query with user input in login endpoint.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Duplicate of web5/dist/app.py, SQL injection risk from unsafe SQL query formatting with raw user input.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries that can be vulnerable to NoSQL injection if user controlled, but no direct user input used here; minor risk in filter endpoint with string formatting passed to $where.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Contains embedded FLAG and database initialization; no direct vulnerability but sensitive data exposure risk if deployed as is.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script; no runtime risk but contains sample user credentials that could be sensitive.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code allowed execution of arbitrary Python code from user input without sanitization, which leads to critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. The fix uses Python's ast module to parse the input code and validate it only contains safe expressions or assignments. It avoids using exec or eval directly with user input. Instead, a restricted environment with no builtins is used during execution. This greatly reduces the risk of executing harmful code.

**Security Notes:** Avoid any direct execution of user input. If dynamic code execution is required, always validate and sandbox the input, restrict builtins, and disallow unsafe nodes in the AST. Consider using specialized sandboxes or domain-specific languages for safer execution.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import traceback

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with various safe and unsafe Python code snippets to ensure rejection of unsafe code.
- Test that allowed expressions execute properly and return expected results.
- Verify no malicious code execution possible, e.g., no file system or OS access.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code lacked authentication and authorization checks on the send money functionality. It trusted client form data for sender identity, enabling unauthorized money transfers and privilege escalation. The fix introduces session-based authentication with login/logout endpoints, and a login_required decorator ensures only authenticated users can send money. The sender is determined from the session instead of user input, preventing spoofing. Input validation and error handling were also added.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate and authorize users on sensitive actions like money transfer. Do not trust client-supplied user identifiers; derive user identity on server from session data. Use secure session management with strong secret keys. Hash passwords in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test send_money without login is rejected.
- Test send_money with login can transfer funds correctly and cannot spoof sender.
- Test balance updates correctly after transfers.

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original PHP gateway.php had no authentication or input validation when updating account balances. It accepted raw POST input and modified accounts.json directly, allowing attackers to manipulate any account. The fix adds session-based authentication checks requiring login. It validates account_id and balance inputs to be numeric and positive. It checks if the account exists and authorizes the user to update only their own account or if the user is admin. This prevents unauthorized manipulation of account funds.

**Security Notes:** Use proper authentication for API endpoints that modify sensitive data. Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Implement authorization checks ensuring users can only operate on their permitted resources. Use HTTPS to protect sessions and data in transit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test endpoint without login returns 401 Unauthorized.
- Test invalid or missing inputs return 400 errors.
- Test user cannot update other user accounts unless admin.
- Test balance updates persist correctly and are reflected in JSON.

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used string formatting to include user inputs directly into the SQL query, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code leading to data compromise or bypass. The fix replaces string concatenation with parameterized queries using placeholders (?) and passing user inputs as parameters to execute(). This prevents SQL injection by safely escaping inputs. Connection and cursor management are cleaned up properly.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when working with SQL databases. Never concatenate or format user input into SQL statements directly. For password storage, hash passwords securely (e.g., bcrypt) rather than storing plaintext passwords.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test special characters in username/password do not cause SQL errors.
- Use penetration testing tools to verify no SQL injection is possible.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** This file had the same SQL injection vulnerability as the web5/dist/app.py file. The fix was to replace unsafe SQL string formatting with parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks. This fix uses the SQLite parameter style with ? placeholders and parameter tuples to safely bind user input values to the query.

**Security Notes:** Same as above. Passwords should be hashed and sessions properly managed in a real application. This fix ensures injection cannot be performed via login queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoints thoroughly after fix as described for dist/app.py.
