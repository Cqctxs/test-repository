## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** This file executes arbitrary Python code from user input without any sanitization or sandboxing via exec(), leading to critical remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Handles financial transactions without proper authentication or authorization checks; whitelisted sender hardcoded; potential for replay or unauthorized transfers; also relies on external PHP gateway that just applies numerical updates without validation, leading to potential account tampering and unauthorized fund manipulation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Processes monetary transaction updates based directly on POST input without authentication, authorization, or input validation, allowing arbitrary modification of account balances.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting with user-supplied input in SQL query; lacks parameterized queries resulting in possible SQL injection attacks allowing authentication bypass or data leakage.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting with user-supplied input in SQL query; lacks parameterized queries resulting in possible SQL injection attacks allowing authentication bypass or data leakage.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** MongoDB queries use $where with stringified JavaScript code with values derived from user input, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities and arbitrary code execution in database queries.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains embedded flag in product data, which is exposed in database and may be revealed unintentionally via application endpoints if published. Also some items are unpublished, but flag is in unpublished accessory.


### Low Risk Files (0)


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Removed use of exec() which executes arbitrary Python code and introduces critical remote code execution vulnerability. Replaced with a safe expression evaluator that only allows mathematical expressions using the ast module and whitelisted nodes. This prevents arbitrary code execution while maintaining the original functionality of evaluating user expressions.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using exec/eval on user input. Use safe evaluation techniques like ast parsing with whitelist of allowed nodes or specialized parsers for math expressions. Disable debug mode in production.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid mathematical expressions to verify correct outputs.
- Test with malicious inputs containing code to verify rejection or error handling.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added proper authentication handling with login and session management. Removed hardcoded whitelisted sender and added validation on amount type and positivity. Ensured that only authenticated users can perform transfers to prevent unauthorized fund manipulation.

**Security Notes:** Always use session or token-based authentication to verify user identity before sensitive actions. Validate and sanitize all inputs. In production, use HTTPS and secure session cookies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoint with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Test transfer endpoint to reject unauthorized access.
- Test input validation with invalid amount or missing receiver.

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check to ensure only authenticated users can update account balances. Validated and sanitized POST inputs for account and amount to prevent invalid data. Used prepared statements for SQL query to prevent SQL injection and incomplete or arbitrary updates. Added error handling for database operations.

**Security Notes:** Never trust POST parameters for critical operations without authentication and authorization. Use prepared statements for all database queries. Validate inputs strictly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized POST calls are rejected.
- Test invalid or missing input parameters are handled correctly.
- Test successful account balance update with valid credentials.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe string formatting in SQL query with parameterized queries using ? placeholders and passing parameters as a tuple. This prevents SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from data inputs. Added input validation to require username parameter.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries/prepared statements to avoid SQL injection. Validate incoming parameters before using them in queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal username to verify data returned.
- Test with special characters to confirm no SQL injection occurs.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe SQL string formatting with parameterized queries using psycopg2?s %s and parameter tuple. This protects against SQL injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not code. Added input validation for username and password presence. Note: Passwords should be hashed with a secure algorithm in production; here it‚Äôs shown as a simple equality for demonstration purposes.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries. Never store or compare passwords in plaintext; use strong password hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import psycopg2
- import psycopg2.extras

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test SQL injection attempts with crafted input to confirm protection.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of $where with stringified JavaScript code which can execute arbitrary code inside MongoDB. Replaced with a safe query using regex operator for user input filtering. This prevents injection attacks by not allowing execution of arbitrary code inside DB queries.

**Security Notes:** Never use $where with user input. Use proper query builders and input validation for NoSQL queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test search with normal strings.
- Test search with special characters or script tags to ensure no injection.

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed embedded flag information from product data to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data. Ensured unpublished items do not contain sensitive flags, and the retrieval function filters out unpublished products to prevent exposure through API endpoints.

**Security Notes:** Sensitive data should never be embedded in database or config if it's not necessary. Use access control to restrict data exposure and sanitize responses.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Check API or data endpoints to verify that flags or sensitive info are not present.
- Test filtering logic for unpublished products.
