- **Risk:** Executes user-submitted Python code directly via exec(), allowing arbitrary code execution and remote code execution vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization; user can send arbitrary amounts except for some minimal checks. The PHP backend does not validate sender or recipient authorization. Allows unauthorized account manipulation, leading to broken authorization and potential privilege escalation.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or input validation on sender and recipient parameters allows arbitrary balance changes; leads to severe broken access control and unauthorized account balance manipulation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability via unsanitized SQL query construction with user input in login route, enabling bypass or data access.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string interpolation in SQL query with user input in login route.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where with unsanitized inputs which may allow MongoDB injection; no explicit authentication or role checks present.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** DATABASE
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive FLAG string in product description field, published as is, potentially exposing a secret if is_published was misconfigured or accessed.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database setup script inserting user data, no immediate security risk but used in conjunction with vulnerable login code.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code used `exec()` on user-submitted Python code, which allows arbitrary code execution and remote code execution vulnerabilities. The fix replaces this with a `safe_eval` function that parses the user's input as a Python expression using `ast.parse` in mode `eval`, and explicitly checks that the AST contains only safe node types. It disallows access to protected members and restricts function calls to a whitelist of safe built-in functions. This provides a controlled and limited evaluation environment instead of executing arbitrary code, mitigating remote code execution risk.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using direct exec or eval on user input. Restrict code evaluation with AST parsing, whitelist safe nodes and functions, and limit globals to safe built-ins. Consider advanced sandboxing for more complex requirements.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- sys
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test various Python expressions for correct evaluations
- Test that unsafe expressions (e.g. import os) are rejected
- Test behavior with malicious input like '__import__("os")'

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code allowed account manipulation with no authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized manipulation and privilege escalation. This fix adds a login system with hashed passwords and session management to authenticate users. The transfer endpoint is protected with a login_required decorator and ensures the sender is the logged-in user, preventing unauthorized account changes. Input validation on transfer amount was also added to ensure valid numeric values.

**Security Notes:** Always validate user inputs, authenticate users properly, and verify authorization before sensitive operations. Hash and salt passwords, manage sessions securely, and do server-side authorization checks for all sensitive endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- flask
- functools
- hashlib

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials
- Test transfer as authenticated and unauthenticated user
- Test transfer with invalid amounts

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original PHP code did not have any authentication or input validation, allowing arbitrary balance changes by any user. The fix adds session-based authentication to require users to be logged in. It uses server-side sender identity (from session), validates recipient to allowed characters, validates amount numeric and positive, and prevents transfers to self. It recommends using PDO with prepared statements to securely query and update balances, preventing SQL injection and access control issues.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate users before sensitive operations in PHP. Use sessions securely, validate all input on the server, use prepared statements to prevent injection, and check authorization before updating accounts.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test transfer without login returns 401
- Test invalid recipients and amounts are rejected
- Test successful transfer updates balances correctly

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code constructed SQL queries by interpolating user input directly, exposing a SQL injection vulnerability. The fix changes the code to use parameterized SQL queries with placeholders `?` and passing username and password parameters as a tuple. This ensures user inputs are treated as data, not executable SQL, preventing injection attacks. Passwords are hashed for security (assuming database stores hashed passwords).

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Store passwords hashed and salted securely, never in plaintext.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- hashlib
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with SQL injection payloads to verify failure
- Test valid and invalid logins as expected

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used unsafe string interpolation in SQL queries with user input, leading to SQL injection. The fix uses parameterized queries to safely pass inputs, preventing injection. Passwords are hashed before comparison as a good security practice, assuming the database stores hashed passwords.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection. Hash and salt passwords before storing/checking.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3
- hashlib
- flask

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with inputs containing SQL meta-characters to verify no injection
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used MongoDB `$where` queries with unsanitized user inputs, enabling NoSQL injection attacks by inserting malicious JavaScript code. The fix removes use of `$where` queries entirely, and uses a standard query dictionary with sanitized input. Username input is validated with an allowlist (alphanumeric only) to prevent injection of special operators. This approach avoids code execution in queries and prevents NoSQL injection.

**Security Notes:** Never use `$where` or JS evaluation in MongoDB queries with user inputs. Always sanitize and validate inputs to NoSQL queries. Use query builders or dictionary queries safely.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- flask
- pymongo

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal usernames
- Test with malicious inputs like {$gt: ''} to verify rejection

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** This file contained a sensitive FLAG string stored in product descriptions, which could be accidentally exposed if the product is published or queried. The fix removes the sensitive string from all data fields, and adds a comment that secrets must never be stored in code or database fields in plaintext. Secure environment variables or secrets management solutions should be used instead.

**Security Notes:** Never hard-code secrets, flags, or keys in code or database fields. Use environment variables or secrets management services. Sanitize or redact data published to clients.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify no secrets appear in product description data
- Review deployment pipeline to prevent secrets in code
