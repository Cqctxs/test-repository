#### 2. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Updates account balances without authentication or input sanitization, allowing unauthorized manipulation.

#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Builds MongoDB $where queries from user input, leading to possible NoSQL/JavaScript injection.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL queries with string interpolation, exposing SQL injection vulnerability.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL queries with string interpolation, exposing SQL injection vulnerability.


### Medium Risk Files (1)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Relies on local gateway for sensitive operations and uses os.system without validation; business logic flaws possible.


### Low Risk Files (2)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Risk:** Initializes database; no direct exposure to user input.

#### 2. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Populates database with sample data; no user‚Äêfacing functionality.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed the use of `exec()` on user input. Introduced `safe_eval()` which parses the expression into an AST and only permits numeric literals and a whitelisted set of arithmetic operators. Input length is capped to mitigate denial-of-service via extremely large expressions.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Further restrict allowed operators or literal types as needed.
‚Ä¢ Consider running in a container or separate process with resource limits to defend against infinite loops or heavy CPU usage.
‚Ä¢ Log invalid attempts for monitoring.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- operator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit tests for valid arithmetic expressions.
- Attempt injection payloads (e.g., `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')`) and verify they're rejected.
- Performance tests with maximum allowed input length.

---

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check. Sanitized inputs using `ctype_digit` and `is_numeric`, then cast to appropriate types. Switched to PDO with prepared statements and enforced that the account belongs to the authenticated user via `user_id`.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Store DB credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager).
‚Ä¢ Implement proper session timeout and regeneration to avoid session fixation.
‚Ä¢ Use HTTPS to protect session cookies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid and expired sessions.
- Attempt parameter tampering and SQL injection payloads.
- Verify unauthorized users cannot change balances.

---

### 3. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed use of MongoDB `$where` with raw user input. Introduced an allowlist (`ALLOWED_FIELDS`) to restrict which document fields can be queried. Queries are built as simple key-value dictionaries, preventing JavaScript injection.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ For numeric or date fields, convert values to the correct type before querying.
‚Ä¢ Monitor query logs for suspicious patterns.
‚Ä¢ Consider adding rate limiting to this endpoint.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt NoSQL injection payloads (e.g., `{ "$gt": "" }`).
- Verify disallowed fields are rejected.
- Test normal lookups for allowed fields.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced string interpolation in SQL with parameterized queries (`?` placeholders). Validated that the incoming `id` is an integer before using it in the query.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Enable WAL mode and secure filesystem permissions on the SQLite file.
‚Ä¢ Consider migrating to a client/server RDBMS for multi-user environments.
‚Ä¢ Add rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection payloads (e.g., `1 OR 1=1`).
- Test with valid and invalid IDs.
- Monitor slow queries.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Converted the dynamic SQL string into a parameterized query using `%s` placeholders with psycopg2. Input is validated to ensure it's an integer before the query.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Secure database credentials (e.g., environment variables).
‚Ä¢ Restrict database user privileges to only necessary operations.
‚Ä¢ Use connection pooling for performance and stability.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject `; DROP TABLE` payloads to confirm no execution.
- Test normal and edge-case product IDs.
- Load-test endpoint under concurrent use.

---

### 6. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** COMMAND_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced `os.system` with `subprocess.run` and `shell=False` to avoid shell interpretation of user input. Inputs are validated via regex for numeric account IDs and parsed as float for the amount.

**Security Notes:** ‚Ä¢ Consider adding authentication/authorization checks before transfers.
‚Ä¢ Log all transfer attempts and outcomes.
‚Ä¢ Rate-limit the endpoint to mitigate abuse.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- subprocess
- re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try command injection payloads (e.g., `; rm -rf /`).
- Verify valid transfers succeed.
- Test invalid account IDs and negative amounts.

   - Verification: Send valid and malicious expressions to `/exec` endpoint.

2. **Deploy `web3/param/gateway.php` updates.**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Add auth and prepared statements'`
   - Verification: Attempt balance update with and without valid session.

3. **Deploy `web4/exec/app.py` update. Validate allowlist logic.**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Prevent NoSQL injection'`
   - Verification: Try queries on disallowed fields.

4. **Deploy SQL fixes for `web5/dist/app.py` and `web5/src/app.py`.**

   - Verification: Attempt SQL injection on `/user` and `/product` endpoints.

5. **Deploy `web3/param/app.py` command injection fix.**
   - Command: `git commit -am 'Use subprocess.run & input validation'`
   - Verification: Try injection payloads against `/transfer`.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor application error logs for unexpected exceptions.
- Track authentication failures and injection attempts.
- Set up alerts for abnormal response codes or slow queries.

## üöÄ Next Steps
