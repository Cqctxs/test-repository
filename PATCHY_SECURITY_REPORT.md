## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-submitted code via exec() without sanitization, leading to critical remote code execution vulnerabilities.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization on money sending endpoints and directly passes manipulated POST data to PHP backend, resulting in critical access control and business logic flaws.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Lack of input validation and authorization; modifies account balances directly based on untrusted POST data, allowing unauthorized fund manipulation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string interpolation in SQL queries with user input.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string interpolation in SQL queries with user input.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB '$where' queries which can result in injection vulnerabilities; no authentication checks present.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** OTHER
- **Risk:** Contains sensitive info such as FLAG value and performs database initialization; risk if exposed publicly.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script with no direct security risks in the code shown but stores passwords in plaintext.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used exec() on user-submitted code without sanitization, which causes critical remote code execution risks. The fixed code replaces exec with a safe evaluator that uses Python's ast module to parse and validate the submitted code to only allow an expression and a set of safe operations and functions. It then evaluates the code in a restricted environment with no builtins except for a whitelist of safe functions. This drastically reduces the risk of malicious code execution while maintaining original functionality of evaluating arithmetic or simple expressions.

**Security Notes:** Always restrict code execution contexts and validate input AST nodes when evaluating user code. Avoid exec() and eval() with user input. Use allowlists of functions and disallow unsafe AST nodes to prevent code injection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import _ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test code submissions including safe expressions return expected results.
- Test attempted malicious code submissions are rejected with errors and no execution.
- Perform fuzz testing with various inputs to ensure no code injection or crashes.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original code failed to implement any authentication or authorization on money sending endpoints, allowing anyone to manipulate POST data and cause unauthorized transactions. The fix adds user login with sessions, authenticates users, and enforces role-based authorization on the send_money endpoint. It also sanitizes and validates input data to ensure correctness and communicates with the backend securely using authentication tokens instead of passing raw POST data. This prevents unauthorized access and tampering of money transfers.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate users before sensitive operations and enforce role-based authorization. Use HTTPS for communication, store secrets securely, and never trust user data directly when modifying critical business data.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import requests
- from flask import session, redirect, url_for, jsonify

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login/logout flows.
- Test authorized and unauthorized access to send_money endpoint.
- Test input validation and error handling.

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** The original PHP API lacked authentication and authorization checks, allowing anyone to submit POST requests that directly manipulated account balances, causing unauthorized fund transfers. The fix implements session-based authentication checking, sanitizes and validates inputs, verifies sender identity from session, ensures recipient exists, and performs balance update within a transaction using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and race conditions. This ensures only authorized users can manipulate their funds and input is validated to prevent tampering or injection.

**Security Notes:** Ensure session management with secure cookies and HTTPS. Use prepared statements for all SQL queries to protect against SQL Injection. Validate and sanitize all inputs. Use transactions to maintain database integrity during balance updates.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test unauthorized requests are rejected.
- Test transfers with valid and invalid recipients and amounts.
- Test concurrent transfers to verify transaction isolation.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code used unsafe string interpolation directly in SQL queries with user input, allowing attackers to perform SQL Injection attacks. The fix uses parameterized queries (sqlite3's '?' placeholders) which safely bind user input and prevent malicious injection. It also adds basic input validation to ensure user_id is numeric before querying.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements with user inputs. Validate and sanitize user inputs. Avoid directly concatenating user inputs into SQL queries.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid and invalid user_id inputs.
- Test SQL injection payloads to ensure they are rejected or handled safely.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code interpolated user input directly into the SQL statement, which allows SQL Injection. This fix parses and validates user input as integer, then uses a parameterized query with psycopg2 to safely query the database. This prevents injection attacks and ensures only valid inputs are processed.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when using user input in SQL queries. Validate inputs before database operations.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import psycopg2

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test various user_id inputs, including invalid and SQL injection attempts.
- Ensure only valid and expected data is returned or error responses are returned appropriately.
