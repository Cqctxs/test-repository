## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (5)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Direct use of exec() on user-submitted code without sanitization allows arbitrary code execution, a critical security vulnerability.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authentication or authorization on money send functionality, allows anyone to send money on behalf of user 'Eatingfood'. Potential privilege escalation and logic flaw. Also uses os.system to start Apache server unnecessarily.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No input validation or authorization for POST requests modifies account balances. This allows unauthorized fund transfers.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query with user input. Allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability due to unsafe string formatting in SQL query with user input. Allows attackers to run arbitrary SQL commands.


### Medium Risk Files (2)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where queries with string interpolation which can lead to injection if inputs are untrusted, though no direct user input is shown here. Also no authentication.

#### 2. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Database initialization script includes insertion of a 'FLAG' item that is unpublished but may be accidentally exposed. No direct access control seen.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization with no direct vulnerabilities, but plaintext passwords in sample data are bad practice.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The direct use of exec() with user input was replaced with a safe evaluation approach using Python's AST module to parse the expression and ensure only basic math expressions (like addition, subtraction) and safe function calls (abs, round) are allowed. Unsafe nodes and function calls raise exceptions, preventing arbitrary code execution. This preserves the functionality of evaluating code but mitigates the risk of executing malicious code.

**Security Notes:** Always avoid exec or eval on user input unless strictly controlled. Using AST parsing restricts which Python constructs can be evaluated safely. Limit callable functions to a known safe subset. Consider whitelisting inputs further if possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- ast
- _ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test valid expression inputs to ensure results are correct.
- Test invalid code inputs to ensure errors are handled safely.
- Test malicious inputs trying to inject code to confirm they are rejected.

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication to protect the money send function and restrict its usage to logged-in users only. Removed previously unnecessary and potentially dangerous os.system call that started the Apache server. This stops unauthorized money transfers and reduces system command injection risk.

**Security Notes:** Always require authentication and proper authorization checks for critical financial operations. Use session or token mechanisms with strong secret keys. Hash passwords and avoid plaintext storage. Remove unnecessary system command executions from web app code.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- functools.wraps
- flask.session
- flask.redirect
- flask.url_for

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login endpoint for valid and invalid credentials.
- Test send_money endpoint without login should fail.
- Test send_money endpoint after login should succeed.
- Ensure os.system call is removed and server starts without shell commands.

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** Added session-based authentication check to ensure only authenticated users can modify account balances. Inputs from POST request are validated for presence and type. Sender's balance is checked before transferring funds to prevent overdraft. Recipient existence is also validated. This mitigates unauthorized fund transfers and input tampering.

**Security Notes:** Implement proper authentication, session management, and verify authorization on all critical operations in PHP web apps. Avoid trusting POST data without validation. Always check and sanitize inputs before database or business logic operations.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test POST request without login fails with 401.
- Test valid authenticated POST request performs transfer correctly.
- Test invalid inputs like negative amount or unknown recipient get 400 errors.

---

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced unsafe string formatting in SQL query with parameterized queries using placeholders and query parameters, which prevents SQL injection by ensuring user inputs are treated as data, not code. Added basic validation of user_id to ensure it is a numeric string before query execution.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when composing SQL queries with user inputs. Never concatenate or format strings directly into queries. Validate input types whenever possible.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test user retrieval for valid and invalid user ids.
- Test attempt to inject SQL via user id is neutralized.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Switched from unsafe string formatting to a parameterized query with placeholders and parameters in the SQLite query, which mitigates the risk of SQL injection. Input username is validated for presence but not overly restricted to allow partial search functionality.

**Security Notes:** Use parameterized queries to separate SQL code from user input. Always validate inputs for presence and reasonable content. Avoid string concatenation in SQL commands.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test username search with safe input returns expected results.
- Test input with SQL injection payload does not modify query semantics.
