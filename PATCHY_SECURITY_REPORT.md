#### 3. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP

## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original vulnerable code executed arbitrary code from user input using exec(), which allows full remote code execution. The fix replaces that with a safe expression evaluator that only allows simple arithmetic operations by parsing the expression securely (using Python's ast module) and explicitly controlling which operators can be used. This prevents execution of arbitrary code. The new code only evaluates safe arithmetic expressions, returning errors for invalid or unsafe input.

**Security Notes:** Never use exec or eval on user input. Always prefer safe parsing and evaluation techniques. Use parsing libraries or domain-specific validators depending on input context. Refrain from exposing raw code execution interfaces publicly. Run the app without debug mode to avoid information leaks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast
- import operator as op

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid arithmetic expressions to ensure correct output.
- Test with malicious input such as system commands to ensure rejection.
- Test empty or malformed input to verify error handling.

### 2. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code allowed arbitrary modification of account balances based purely on POST parameters with no authentication or authorization checks, enabling arbitrary fund transfers. The fix adds session-based authentication and authorization checks: verifies if the user is logged in and authorized to perform transfers. It also validates inputs (account_id as int, amount as positive float) and uses prepared statements for the database update to avoid SQL injection. Error handling is improved with proper HTTP response codes and JSON messages.

**Security Notes:** Always enforce authentication and granular authorization on sensitive API endpoints. Use session management to track authenticated users. Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection and logical attacks. Handle database operations with parameterized queries. Return appropriate HTTP status codes for client errors.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test API calls without authentication to confirm denial.
- Test with authorized users to confirm successful operation.
- Test invalid or missing parameters to confirm validation works.

### 3. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** This fix adds proper authentication using Flask session with login required decorators to ensure users are logged in before performing money transfer. It enforces authorization by checking user permission (can_transfer flag) prior to transfer. Input validation is added for amount and account identifiers. Calls to external backend server for account state are wrapped in try-except and use secure HTTPS with timeout. Business logic checks prevent overdraft. This prevents unauthorized sending of money and bypass of business rules.

**Security Notes:** Always authenticate and authorize access to critical operations. Use secure communication (HTTPS) for backend calls. Validate and sanitize inputs. Use hashed passwords and secure session management. Implement transaction atomicity in real deployments.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from flask import session
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test login with valid and invalid credentials.
- Test transfer without login to confirm rejection.
- Test transfer with user lacking authorization to confirm rejection.
- Test transfer with insufficient funds to confirm business logic enforcement.
- Test successful transfer flow.

### 4. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** The original code directly interpolated unsanitized user input into an SQL query string, allowing SQL injection attacks. The fix uses a parameterized query with the '?' placeholder and passing the user input as a parameter tuple to the execute() method. This prevents the user input from being treated as executable SQL and protects the database from injection. Additionally, row_factory is set to sqlite3.Row for better result handling.

**Security Notes:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. Never concatenate user input into SQL statements directly. Validate and sanitize user inputs accordingly. Disable debug mode in production to avoid information leaks.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with normal query strings returning valid results.
- Test with strings containing SQL keywords or special characters to confirm no injection.
- Test with empty or missing input.

---

### 5. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** This fix addresses SQL injection by using parameterized queries rather than string interpolation for the user_id variable. Additionally, it validates that user_id consists only of digits before querying. This prevents malicious input from modifying the SQL query. It uses sqlite3 parameter substitution properly and disables debug mode.

**Security Notes:** Always validate input type and format. Use parameterized queries. Avoid exposing detailed errors in production. Use row_factory for convenient row dictionary access.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import sqlite3

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid user IDs retrieving user data.
- Attempt injection using SQL code in user_id to confirm refusal.
- Test missing or invalid user ID handling.

---

### 6. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** This fix removes the use of the MongoDB $where operator with user input JavaScript code, which posed a risk of NoSQL injection and arbitrary code execution. Instead, it uses a whitelist of allowed categories to validate the input. The query uses a safe dictionary filter without any JavaScript execution to retrieve products by category. This prevents any user-controlled code from being executed in the database.

**Security Notes:** Avoid using operators like $where with user input in MongoDB queries. Use allowlist validation for input parameters that narrow queries. Always validate and sanitize inputs to NoSQL queries preventing code injection. Serialize ObjectId to string before JSON returning.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- from pymongo import MongoClient

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with allowed category values returns correct products.
- Test with disallowed category returns HTTP 400 error.
- Test with empty or missing category parameter.
