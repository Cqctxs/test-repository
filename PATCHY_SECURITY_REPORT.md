## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (6)

#### 1. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web2/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Executes arbitrary user-supplied code via exec(), leading to remote code execution risk.

#### 2. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web3/param/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** No authorization on sensitive flag access and insecure remote code execution via os.system; logic flaws allow flag exposure.

#### 3. gateway.php (PHP)
- **Path:** `web3/param/gateway.php`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No authentication or input validation on account operations; allows arbitrary balance modification and potential JSON manipulation.

#### 4. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/app.py`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Uses MongoDB $where with unsanitized input, leading to NoSQL injection; exposes internal FLAG via database init.

#### 5. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/dist/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL query via f-string with unsanitized user input, leading to SQL injection.

#### 6. app.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/app.py`
- **Type:** WEB_APP
- **Risk:** Constructs SQL query via f-string with unsanitized user input, leading to SQL injection.


### Medium Risk Files (1)

#### 1. db.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web4/exec/db.py`
- **Type:** OTHER
- **Risk:** Initializes database with secret FLAG in a product record; flag stored but not published, potential leakage if filters bypass is_published.


### Low Risk Files (1)

#### 1. insert.py (Python)
- **Path:** `web5/src/insert.py`
- **Risk:** Database initialization script with sample credentials; contains plaintext passwords but no direct exposure endpoint.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. web2/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced direct exec() of user-supplied code with a safe evaluator using Python's ast module. Only numeric literals and arithmetic operators are allowed. Any other AST node (e.g., imports, function calls, attribute access) triggers an error.

**Security Notes:** - Always whitelist AST nodes when evaluating untrusted expressions.
- Return clear errors on invalid input but avoid leaking internals in production.
- If more functionality is required, consider a sandboxing library like RestrictedPython.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import ast

**Testing Recommendations:**
- POST valid arithmetic expressions and verify correct result
- POST malicious code (e.g., __import__('os')) and verify rejection

---

### 2. web3/param/app.py
**Vulnerability:** COMMAND_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1. Introduced API key authentication via X-API-Key header.
2. Loaded sensitive FLAG from environment instead of hardcoding.
3. Replaced os.system with subprocess.run(shell=False) and validated characters in the command input to prevent injection.


**Security Notes:** - Always store secrets (API_KEY, FLAG) in environment or secure vault.
- Validate and whitelist user input before passing to subprocess.
- Return sanitized error messages to avoid leaking internals.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import re
- import subprocess
- from functools import wraps

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call /run and /flag without API key (should 403)
- Call /run with invalid characters (should 400)
- Call /run with valid command and verify output
- Call /flag with valid key and verify flag

---

### 3. web3/param/gateway.php
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1. Added session-based authorization so only logged-in users can modify their own accounts.
2. Switched to PDO with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
3. Validated and cast incoming JSON fields to expected types before use.

**Security Notes:** - Store DB credentials in environment variables.
- Implement proper login and session timeout to further lock down endpoints.
- In production, use HTTPS and set secure cookie flags.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt operations as anonymous user (should 401)
- Attempt to modify other user‚Äôs account (should not succeed)
- SQL injection payloads in input fields (should not succeed)

---

### 4. web4/exec/app.py
**Vulnerability:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1. Removed use of MongoDB‚Äôs $where (which can execute JS) and replaced with a regex filter.
2. Sanitized the user input to remove special characters.
3. Enforced the is_published filter server-side so internal flags/records cannot leak.

**Security Notes:** - Never store sensitive data in database seeds if it must stay secret.
- Use role-based access control for any privileged queries.
- Consider rate-limiting search endpoints.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import re

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Inject regex metacharacters (should be sanitized)
- Verify unpublished products are never returned

---

### 5. web5/dist/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Changed the f-string SQL construction to a parameterized query using sqlite3‚Äôs built-in placeholders. This prevents injection by treating user input as data only.

**Security Notes:** - In production, you should hash passwords instead of storing plaintext.
- Use HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.
- Consider using SQLAlchemy for ORM and built-in sanitization.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt injection in username/password fields
- Ensure correct responses for valid/invalid credentials

---

### 6. web5/src/app.py
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced the f-string SQL query with a parameterized query, passing the user-supplied ID as a parameter to prevent injection.

**Security Notes:** - Validate that user_id is numeric (e.g., cast to int) if your schema requires it.
- Again, do not store passwords in plaintext.
- Consider adding authentication around this endpoint.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- SQL injection attempts via id parameter
- Valid id returns correct data

---

### 7. web4/exec/db.py
**Vulnerability:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed the hardcoded secret flag from the database seed. Now only non-sensitive product data is initialized. The FLAG should be stored in environment or a secure vault.

**Security Notes:** - Do not store any sensitive flag or secret in publicly queryable collections.
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager for flags and credentials.
- Ensure seed scripts are idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Run seeding and verify no flag document exists
- Ensure published filter still works without flag entry

---

### 8. web5/src/insert.py
**Vulnerability:** HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1. Removed hardcoded plaintext passwords; now read from environment variables.
2. Implemented bcrypt hashing for all user passwords before storage.
3. Created users table with a password_hash column.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure environment variables for credentials are set securely (e.g., in CI/CD secrets).
- Use a strong work factor for bcrypt (adjust rounds as needed).
- Never log plaintext passwords.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- import bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify database has hashed passwords
- Ensure invalid/missing env variables cause errors

---

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor application logs for 4xx/5xx error spikes
