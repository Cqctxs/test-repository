# Security Fix for web3/param/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

## Original Issue
Implemented strict authorization checks on sender and recipient. Restricted sending money to a disallowed recipient. Validated inputs including amount. Changed backend request to use JSON payload safely rather than forwarding raw data. Added proper aborts with HTTP error codes.

## Security Notes
Always fully validate and authorize all parameters especially in financial transactions. Prefer strong identity checks and avoid bypasses. Use proper input validation and backend communication with secure protocols.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, abort
import requests
app = Flask(__name__)

VALID_USERS = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}
RESTRICTED_RECIPIENTS = {'Eatingfood'}

@app.route('/send_money', methods=['POST'])
def send_money():
    sender = request.json.get('sender')
    recipient = request.json.get('recipient')
    amount = request.json.get('amount')

    # Basic validation and authorization checks
    if sender not in VALID_USERS:
        abort(403, description='Unauthorized sender')
    if recipient not in VALID_USERS:
        abort(403, description='Recipient not authorized')

    if recipient in RESTRICTED_RECIPIENTS:
        abort(403, description='Cannot send money to this recipient')

    if amount is None or amount <= 0:
        abort(400, description='Invalid amount')

    # Relay request to backend using safe parameter passing
    backend_url = 'https://backend.example.com/send'
    payload = {'sender': sender, 'recipient': recipient, 'amount': amount}

    # Use requests with JSON payload for backend call
    response = requests.post(backend_url, json=payload)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Backend error'}), 500

    return jsonify({'status': 'success'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Additional Dependencies
- from flask import abort
- import requests

## Testing Recommendations
- Test sending money with unauthorized users and recipients and verify requests are rejected.
- Test sending money to restricted recipient to confirm block.
- Test valid transactions pass and result in backend call.
- Perform fuzz tests with incorrect or missing data.

## Alternative Solutions

### Add strong authentication like OAuth or JWT tokens to verify user identity on each request.
**Pros:** Stronger security and user validation, Prevents impersonation
**Cons:** Additional complexity, Requires token issuance and storage

### Implement backend authorization to enforce business rules rather than relying on frontend.
**Pros:** Centralized control and easier auditing
**Cons:** Backend may be more complex
