# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
The original code used MongoDB $where queries with string interpolation, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to severe NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities. The fix removes usage of $where and replaces it with a safe, structured query builder that matches exact values. Additionally, it validates the field name to only allow valid alphanumeric fields, mitigating injection. Sensitive data such as 'flag' is removed from results to prevent information disclosure. This preserves original query functionality securely without code injection risk.

## Security Notes
Avoid using MongoDB $where with user input as it allows JS code execution. Use structured queries with validated keys and sanitized values. Remove or mask sensitive data before responding. Enforce authentication for sensitive data endpoints.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydb']
collection = db['mycollection']

@app.route('/find', methods=['POST'])
def find_documents():
    data = request.get_json()
    field = data.get('field')
    value = data.get('value')

    # Input validation: allow only alphanumeric field names without special chars
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$', field):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid field name'}), 400

    # Use safe query without $where
    query = {field: value}
    results = list(collection.find(query))

    # Remove sensitive fields before returning
    for r in results:
        if '_id' in r:
            r['_id'] = str(r['_id'])
        if 'flag' in r:
            del r['flag']  # Prevent sensitive info disclosure

    return jsonify(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Testing Recommendations
- Test queries with valid and invalid fields to confirm validation.
- Test injection attempts with JS code to ensure they fail.
- Test that sensitive fields are not returned in API responses.

## Alternative Solutions

### Use a query builder library that abstracts query construction and enforces input safety.
**Pros:** Reduces manual query risks., Easier maintenance.
**Cons:** undefined

### Implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict data access to authorized users only.
**Pros:** Reduces info disclosure risks., Granular access control.
**Cons:** undefined
