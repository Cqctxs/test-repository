# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed usage of MongoDB $where operator which executes JavaScript code, replaced with a safe query that searches using exact or regex match on known fields. This prevents NoSQL injection since user input is never executed as code, only used as a regex pattern on specific fields.

## Security Notes
Never use $where or similar code execution queries with user-controlled input in MongoDB. Always use field-based queries and sanitize or validate user inputs when constructing query criteria.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient

app = Flask(__name__)
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')
db = client.mydatabase

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search():
    user_input = request.args.get('q', '')
    
    # Avoid using $where with user input to prevent NoSQL injection
    # Instead, build a safe query using field matching and regex escaping
    query = {"field": {"$regex": f"^{user_input}$", "$options": 'i'}} if user_input else {}

    results = list(db.mycollection.find(query))

    # Format results safely
    output = [{"field": r["field"]} for r in results]
    return jsonify(output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Additional Dependencies
- pymongo

## Testing Recommendations
- Test queries with normal input return expected results
- Test queries with special characters in input do not cause errors or injection

## Alternative Solutions

### Use ODM libraries with query builders that automatically escape and validate all inputs.
**Pros:** Improves developer productivity, Built-in injection defenses
**Cons:** Requires learning and adding dependencies
