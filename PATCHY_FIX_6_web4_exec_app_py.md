# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed use of $where with stringified JavaScript code which can execute arbitrary code inside MongoDB. Replaced with a safe query using regex operator for user input filtering. This prevents injection attacks by not allowing execution of arbitrary code inside DB queries.

## Security Notes
Never use $where with user input. Use proper query builders and input validation for NoSQL queries.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient

app = Flask(__name__)
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.mydatabase

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_products():
    # Get user input safely
    search_term = request.args.get('search_term', '')

    # Avoid using $where or raw JavaScript expressions to prevent NoSQL injection
    # Instead, use safe query expressions with regex or exact matches
    query = {"product_name": {"$regex": search_term, "$options": "i"}}  # case-insensitive search

    results = list(db.products.find(query))
    for r in results:
        r['_id'] = str(r['_id'])  # Convert ObjectId to string for JSON serialization

    return jsonify(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False)
```

## Additional Dependencies
- from pymongo import MongoClient

## Testing Recommendations
- Test search with normal strings.
- Test search with special characters or script tags to ensure no injection.

## Alternative Solutions

### Use full text search indexing instead of regex for better performance.
**Pros:** More efficient search., Safe query construction.
**Cons:** Requires MongoDB text index setup.
