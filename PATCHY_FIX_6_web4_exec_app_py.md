# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

## Original Issue
Removed use of MongoDB $where clause with user input, which executes JavaScript and is vulnerable to injection. Instead, used a safe query with $regex and validated input for expected format. This prevents arbitrary code execution in database queries.

## Security Notes
Avoid using $where or any JavaScript evaluation in NoSQL queries with untrusted input. Use proper query operators and sanitize inputs carefully.

## Fixed Code
```py
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.mydb

user_input = input('Enter search term: ')

# Validate and escape user input - do not use $where queries with direct user input
# Instead use query operators safely

safe_query = {"field": {"$regex": f"^{user_input}$"}}  # Restrictive matching example
results = db.collection.find(safe_query)

for doc in results:
    print(doc)

client.close()
```

## Additional Dependencies
- from pymongo import MongoClient

## Testing Recommendations
- Test input with malicious JavaScript injection strings and verify no execution occurs.
- Test with valid input for correct search results.

## Alternative Solutions

### Use strict input validation with an allowlist of acceptable values
**Pros:** Reduces attack surface
**Cons:** May limit functionality
