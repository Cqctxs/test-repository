# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
The original code introduced NoSQL injection risks by using the $where operator with interpolated user input in the MongoDB query. The fix removes usage of $where and instead uses a parameterized query with $regex operator, which is designed to safely match strings. The input is validated to be a string and length-limited to prevent abuse. This prevents NoSQL injection attacks via malicious JavaScript in $where.

## Security Notes
Avoid using $where operator with any user-supplied input. Always validate and sanitize inputs sent to database query functions. Use the appropriate MongoDB operators for filtering rather than executing JavaScript code. Consider further input normalization or allowlists as needed.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient

app = Flask(__name__)
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.mydatabase

@app.route('/search', methods=['POST'])
def search():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    # Properly build MongoDB query avoiding $where and string interpolation
    search_term = data.get('search_term', '')

    # Validate and sanitize inputs
    if not isinstance(search_term, str) or len(search_term) > 100:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid search term'}), 400

    # Use $regex for safe pattern matching instead of $where
    query = {'name': {'$regex': f'^{search_term}', '$options': 'i'}}
    results = list(db.products.find(query))

    # Convert ObjectId to string for JSON serialization
    for r in results:
        r['_id'] = str(r['_id'])

    return jsonify(results)

```

## Additional Dependencies
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- from pymongo import MongoClient

## Testing Recommendations
- Test search inputs with malicious JavaScript code to ensure no injection.
- Test normal search functionality.
- Confirm input validation rejects inappropriate inputs.

## Alternative Solutions

### Use a strict allowlist on allowed search terms or IDs to fully control queries.
**Pros:** Maximizes query safety., Simplifies input validation.
**Cons:** May reduce flexibility for search queries.
