# Security Fix for web4/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** NOSQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
The original code used MongoDB's $where clause with interpolated user input which is executed as JavaScript code leading to NoSQL injection. Fixed code replaces $where with direct field matching, which is safer. It also sanitizes the 'category' input to allow only alphanumeric and underscore characters to prevent injection in query selectors.

## Security Notes
Avoid using $where in MongoDB queries with user input. Use direct key-value queries. Sanitize input carefully. Implement authentication if necessary to restrict access to sensitive data.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient

app = Flask(__name__)
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.mydatabase

@app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
    category = request.args.get('category')

    query = {}
    if category:
        # Do not use $where or eval, use direct field equality matching
        # Also sanitize input by allowing only alphanumeric and underscore characters
        import re
        if not re.match(r'^\w+$', category):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid category format'}), 400

        query['category'] = category

    products = list(db.products.find(query))
    for product in products:
        product['_id'] = str(product['_id'])  # serialize ObjectId

    return jsonify(products)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Additional Dependencies
- from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
- from pymongo import MongoClient
- import re

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with valid and invalid category inputs to confirm query behavior.
- Attempt to pass JavaScript code or operators in category and confirm rejection.

## Alternative Solutions

### Implement role-based access control to restrict who can make queries.
**Pros:** Improves overall app security, Limits exposure of data
**Cons:** Requires additional implementation complexity

### Use MongoDB schema validation to enforce allowed fields and types.
**Pros:** Server-side validation, Reduces injection and malformed data risks
**Cons:** Schema support depends on MongoDB version and setup
