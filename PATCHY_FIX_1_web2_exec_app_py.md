# Security Fix for web2/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

## Original Issue
The original code executed arbitrary code from user input without any sanitization, leading to full remote code execution risk. The fix replaces direct exec with parsing the input code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and walks the tree to validate that only safe nodes are present (basic literals and arithmetic). We then safely compile and execute this limited code in a restricted environment without built-ins to prevent malicious operations.

## Security Notes
Avoid using exec or eval on user input. When dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, validate and sanitize input through AST parsing and restricting allowed syntax nodes. Running in restricted globals disables built-in dangerous functions.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import ast

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
def execute_code():
    code = request.json.get('code', '')
    
    # Parse the code to an AST node safely to prevent execution of arbitrary code
    try:
        tree = ast.parse(code, mode='exec')
    except SyntaxError:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid code syntax'}), 400

    # Only allow expressions consisting of safe nodes (e.g., literals, arithmetic)
    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if not isinstance(node, (ast.Module, ast.Expr, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num,
                                 ast.Str, ast.NameConstant, ast.Name, ast.Load, ast.operator, ast.unaryop)):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Unsafe code detected'}), 400

    # Evaluate the expression safely (using eval on safe node tree is still discouraged, here used with literals as example)
    try:
        result = eval(compile(tree, filename='<ast>', mode='exec'), {'__builtins__': {}})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Error executing code: ' + str(e)}), 400

    return jsonify({'result': result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Additional Dependencies
- import ast

## Testing Recommendations
- Test valid safe arithmetic expressions execute correctly.
- Test malicious code injections (e.g., import os) are rejected with error.
- Test syntactically invalid code returns proper syntax error response

## Alternative Solutions

### Remove code execution functionality entirely and replace with predefined commands or actions allowed from user.
**Pros:** Complete removal of risk from code injection., Simplifies the codebase.
**Cons:** Lose flexibility of arbitrary code execution functionality., Might require significant redesign.

### Use a sandboxed execution environment like restricted Python interpreters or external services that limit capabilities.
**Pros:** Better isolation and security., Can allow more complex code safely.
**Cons:** Increased complexity and dependencies., Potential performance overhead.
