# Security Fix for web2/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Replaced arbitrary execution of user input via exec or eval with safe evaluation using ast.literal_eval which only allows Python literals (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts) and prohibits arbitrary code execution. Added input validation to check for the 'code' parameter in JSON. This removes the remote code execution vulnerability while maintaining the ability to process safe expressions.

## Security Notes
Avoid executing arbitrary code input directly. Use safe parsing/evaluation methods. Always validate and sanitize input. Disable debug mode in production. Consider rate limiting and authentication.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import ast

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
def execute_code():
    # Accepts only JSON with python expressions safely evaluated
    try:
        data = request.json
        if 'code' not in data:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Missing code parameter'}), 400

        # Using ast.literal_eval for safely evaluating literals only
        # This prevents arbitrary code execution present in original eval/exec use
        expression = data['code']
        try:
            parsed = ast.literal_eval(expression)
        except Exception:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Code evaluation failed, only safe expressions allowed'}), 400

        return jsonify({'result': parsed}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False)  

```

## Additional Dependencies
- import ast

## Testing Recommendations
- Test that safe literals (strings, numbers, lists) are processed correctly.
- Test rejected inputs such as code containing function calls or imports throw errors.
- Verify no arbitrary code execution is possible by testing malicious inputs like '__import__("os").system("ls")'.

## Alternative Solutions

### Implement a whitelist of allowed commands and parse user input to only allow those commands safely.
**Pros:** More control over commands users can run, Less risk than full evaluation
**Cons:** More complex to implement, May limit functionality

### Remove functionality requiring code evaluation entirely and replace with predefined APIs or commands.
**Pros:** Eliminates risk of code execution vulnerabilities
**Cons:** Potentially loss of dynamic behavior or functionality
