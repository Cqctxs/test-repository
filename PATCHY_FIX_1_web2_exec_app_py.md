# Security Fix for web2/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

## Original Issue
Replaced direct exec() call on user-provided code with AST parsing to validate and reject potentially dangerous code constructs like imports or exec calls. Completely removed execution step to prevent remote code execution (RCE). Respond with an informative message instead.

## Security Notes
Never execute user input directly. Use AST parsing or restricted interpreters to analyze code safely. Consider running any necessary code in a sandboxed environment with strict controls. Implement proper authorization to restrict who can submit code.

## Fixed Code
```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import ast

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
def execute_code():
    code = request.json.get('code')
    try:
        # Parse the code using ast to ensure it's valid Python code without executing it directly
        tree = ast.parse(code, mode='exec')
        # Safe evaluation: execute only expressions or limited commands allowed
        # Here we can limit the nodes allowed for execution or reject unsafe code
        # For demonstration, we reject if any Import, Exec, or dangerous nodes appear
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, (ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom, ast.Exec, ast.Call)):
                # Reject if import or exec or function calls found
                return jsonify({'error': 'Unsafe code detected'}), 400
        # Instead of exec, we could define a safe set of allowed operations
        # But to keep functionality while blocking arbitrary code execution, we do not run the code
        return jsonify({'message': 'Code received and parsed successfully, execution blocked for safety.'})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Invalid code: {str(e)}'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0')

```

## Additional Dependencies
- import ast

## Testing Recommendations
- Send various code snippets via POST /execute verifying safe rejection
- Attempt to send imports or system calls to ensure they are blocked
- Verify error messages do not leak internal details

## Alternative Solutions

### Implement a full sandbox environment to execute user code safely (e.g., via Docker containers with resource limits).
**Pros:** Allows functionality of code execution, Ensures isolation from the host environment
**Cons:** Complex to implement correctly, Needs resource management and continuous monitoring

### Whitelist specific commands or a domain-specific language instead of raw Python code execution.
**Pros:** Limits surface for attacks, More controlled execution environment
**Cons:** Limited functionality, Requires new language or command parser
