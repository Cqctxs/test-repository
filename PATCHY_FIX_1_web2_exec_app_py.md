# Security Fix for web2/exec/app.py

**Vulnerability Type:** CODE_INJECTION  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

## Original Issue
Removed the dangerous use of exec() which executes arbitrary Python code submitted by the user. Instead, implemented a safe expression evaluator using ast module that parses and only allows numeric and arithmetic expressions, blocking code execution risks.

## Security Notes
Avoid using eval()/exec() with user input. Use restricted evaluators like ast.literal_eval where possible. For any code execution features, implement strong sandboxing and validation.

## Fixed Code
```py
# Secure replacement for exec execution
# Instead of using exec(), implement a restricted environment for code evaluation using ast.literal_eval or similar safe methods.
import ast

def safe_eval(expr):
    """Safely evaluate an arithmetic expression."""
    try:
        # Parse expression to ensure it's safe
        node = ast.parse(expr, mode='eval')
        # Allow only literals and arithmetic expressions
        for subnode in ast.walk(node):
            if not isinstance(subnode, (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num, ast.operator, ast.unaryop)):
                raise ValueError('Unsupported operation')
        return eval(compile(node, '<string>', mode='eval'))
    except Exception as e:
        return f'Error: {str(e)}'

# Usage example:
# result = safe_eval(user_input)

# Explanation: This code replaces the use of exec() on user-supplied code with a safe evaluation strategy that only supports arithmetic expressions and literals. It blocks arbitrary code execution by inspecting the AST nodes and evaluating only approved node types.
```

## Additional Dependencies
- import ast

## Testing Recommendations
- Test with various malicious inputs containing code injection attempts to verify rejection.
- Test expected arithmetic expressions to verify correct evaluation.

## Alternative Solutions

### Use a third-party sandboxed execution environment
**Pros:** Allows more complex code execution safely, Better isolation
**Cons:** More complex to setup, May have performance overhead

### Remove dynamic code execution feature entirely
**Pros:** Eliminates risk completely, Simplifies application security
**Cons:** Less flexible functionality
