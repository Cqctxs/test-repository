# Security Fix for web4/exec/db.py

**Vulnerability Type:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
This file contained a sensitive FLAG string stored in product descriptions, which could be accidentally exposed if the product is published or queried. The fix removes the sensitive string from all data fields, and adds a comment that secrets must never be stored in code or database fields in plaintext. Secure environment variables or secrets management solutions should be used instead.

## Security Notes
Never hard-code secrets, flags, or keys in code or database fields. Use environment variables or secrets management services. Sanitize or redact data published to clients.

## Fixed Code
```py
# Removed sensitive FLAG string from product description.
# Ideally, secrets should never be stored in code or databases in plaintext.

products = [
    {
        'id': 1,
        'name': 'Product A',
        'description': 'A great product',
        'price': 9.99,
        'is_published': True
    },
    {
        'id': 2,
        'name': 'Product B',
        'description': 'Another great product',
        'price': 19.99,
        'is_published': False
    }
]

# Note: Secrets should be stored securely in environment variables or secure vaults.

```

## Additional Dependencies
None

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify no secrets appear in product description data
- Review deployment pipeline to prevent secrets in code

## Alternative Solutions

### Use environment variables and secrets vaults to inject secrets at runtime
**Pros:** No secrets in code, Allows rotation
**Cons:** Infrastructure complexity
