# Security Fix for web4/exec/db.py

**Vulnerability Type:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed hardcoded sensitive FLAG from database seed data. Sensitive information should not be stored or distributed in code repositories or database seed files to avoid accidental leakage.

## Security Notes
Secrets and flags must be stored securely using environment variables or secret management tools, not in code or seed data. Ensure file permissions and accessibility are restricted.

## Fixed Code
```py
# This seed data file contains sensitive FLAG item.
# Ensure this file is not accessible via the web server.
# Restrict access permissions to this file.

seed_data = [
    {'name': 'user1', 'password': 'hashed_password1'},
    {'name': 'user2', 'password': 'hashed_password2'},
    # Do not include secrets or flags in production databases or code
]

# FLAG removed from this seed data file for security reasons.

```

## Additional Dependencies
None

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify flag or secrets cannot be accessed via API or web
- Review all seed files for sensitive data

## Alternative Solutions

### Use encrypted secrets management and inject secrets at runtime
**Pros:** More secure, reduces risk of leaks
**Cons:** Requires secret management infrastructure
