# Security Fix for web4/exec/db.py

**Vulnerability Type:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed the initialization of the product labeled 'FLAG' with is_published=0 to prevent accidental exposure. Instead, such sensitive products should be managed separately with access controls.

## Security Notes
Sensitive or unpublished products should not be exposed in general product listings or initialization scripts. Implement role-based access controls to hide sensitive features or data.

## Fixed Code
```py
products = [
    {
        'id': '1',
        'name': 'Regular Product',
        'price': 19.99,
        'is_published': 1
    },
    # 'FLAG' product is no longer included in public initialization
]

# The 'FLAG' product should be loaded conditionally only for admin or special roles from secure storage.

```

## Additional Dependencies
None

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify that 'FLAG' product does not appear in public API or database initializations
- Test with users with and without admin roles to confirm visibility controls

## Alternative Solutions

### Keep 'FLAG' product but conditionally load it based on user role with backend checks.
**Pros:** Allows visibility to authorized users only
**Cons:** Requires additional role management implementation
