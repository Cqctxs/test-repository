# Security Fix for web4/exec/db.py

**Vulnerability Type:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed embedded flag information from product data to prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data. Ensured unpublished items do not contain sensitive flags, and the retrieval function filters out unpublished products to prevent exposure through API endpoints.

## Security Notes
Sensitive data should never be embedded in database or config if it's not necessary. Use access control to restrict data exposure and sanitize responses.

## Fixed Code
```py
# Product data stored without embedding sensitive flags in product descriptions
# Unpublished products remain unpublished and no sensitive info is included

products = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Accessory A', 'published': True},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Accessory B', 'published': False},
    # Removed embedded flag information from product data
]

# Function to retrieve products - ensure unpublished products are filtered out

def get_published_products():
    return [p for p in products if p['published']]

# Logging or debug statements should never expose sensitive data


```

## Additional Dependencies
None

## Testing Recommendations
- Check API or data endpoints to verify that flags or sensitive info are not present.
- Test filtering logic for unpublished products.

## Alternative Solutions
