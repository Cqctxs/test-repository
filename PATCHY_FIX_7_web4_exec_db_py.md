# Security Fix for web4/exec/db.py

**Vulnerability Type:** INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE  
**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

## Original Issue
Removed insertion of plain FLAG directly into the database. Instead, encrypted the flag using Fernet symmetric encryption before inserting into the database. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data if is_published is mishandled. The encryption key should be stored securely and not hardcoded in production.

## Security Notes
Sensitive data should never be stored in plaintext in databases. Use encryption and restrict access along with proper access control. Use environment variables or secure key management for encryption keys.

## Fixed Code
```py
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']

# Initialize database without inserting sensitive FLAG in unprotected state
# Instead, store the FLAG encrypted or in a protected collection with access controls

# Example: insert a hashed or encrypted flag (placeholder)
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

flag_plain = 'FLAG{secret_flag_value}'
encrypted_flag = cipher_suite.encrypt(flag_plain.encode())

db.secrets.insert_one({'name': 'flag', 'value': encrypted_flag, 'is_published': 0})

print('Sensitive data encrypted and stored securely.')

```

## Additional Dependencies
- from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify that the stored value is encrypted and not plaintext.
- Attempt to fetch flag without key and ensure data cannot be read.

## Alternative Solutions

### Do not insert sensitive data directly into development or production databases. Store separately with access controls.
**Pros:** Minimizes exposure risk., Simpler handling.
**Cons:** Requires external secret management.
